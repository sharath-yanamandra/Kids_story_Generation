Then listen to the stories it tells; it sings them aloud, one kind of song among the trees of the forest, and a very different one when it is pent up within walls with all their cracks and crannies. Do you see how the wind chases the white fleecy clouds as if they were a flock of sheep? Do you hear the wind down there, howling in the open doorway like a watchman winding his horn? Then, too, how he whistles in the chimneys, making the fire crackle and sparkle. How cosy it is to sit in the warm glow of the fire listening to the tales it has to tell! Let the wind tell its own story! It can tell you more adventures than all of us put together. Listen now:—</p>\\n<p>&#8216;Whew!—Whew!—Fare away!&#8217; That was the refrain of his song.<a id=\"Page_220\" name=\"Page_220\"></a></p>\\n<p>&#8216;Close to the Great Belt stands an old mansion with thick red walls,&#8217; says the wind. &#8216;I know every stone of it; I knew them before when they formed part of Marsk Stig&#8217;s Castle on the Ness. It had to come down. The stones were used again, and made a new wall of a new castle in another place—Borreby Hall as it now stands.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;I have watched the highborn men and women of all the various races who have lived there, and now I am going to tell you about Waldemar Daa and his daughters!</p>\\n<p>&#8216;He held his head very high, for he came of a royal stock! He knew more than the mere chasing of a stag, or the emptying of a flagon; he knew how to manage his affairs, he said himself.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;His lady wife walked proudly across the brightly polished floors, in her gold brocaded kirtle; the tapestries in the rooms were gorgeous, and the furniture of costly carved woods. She had brought much gold and silver plate into the house with her, and the cellars were full of German ale, when there was anything there at all. Fiery black horses neighed in the stables; Borreby Hall was a very rich place when wealth came there.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;Then there were the children, three dainty maidens, Ida, Johanna and Anna Dorothea. I remember their names well.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;They were rich and aristocratic people, and they were born and bred in wealth! Whew!—whew!—fare away!&#8217; roared the wind, then he went on with his story.<a id=\"Page_221\" name=\"Page_221\"></a></p>\\n<p>&#8216;I did not see here, as in other old noble castles the highborn lady sitting among her maidens in the great hall turning the spinning-wheel. No, she played upon the ringing lute, and sang to its tones. Her songs were not always the old Danish ditties, however, but songs in foreign tongues. All was life and hospitality; noble guests came from far and wide; there were sounds of music and the clanging of flagons, so loud that I could not drown them!&#8217; said the wind. &#8216;Here were arrogance and ostentation enough and to spare; plenty of lords, but the Lord had no place there.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;Then came the evening of May-day!&#8217; said the wind. &#8216;I came from the west; I had been watching ships being wrecked and broken up on the west coast of Jutland. I tore over the heaths and the green wooded coasts, across the island of Funen and over the Great Belt puffing and blowing. I settled down to rest on the coast of Zealand close to Borreby Hall, where the splendid forest of oaks still stood. The young bachelors of the neighbourhood came out and collected faggots and branches, the longest and driest they could find. These they took to the town, piled them up in a heap, and set fire to them; then the men and maidens danced and sang round the bonfire. I lay still,&#8217; said the wind, &#8216;but I softly moved a branch, the one laid by the handsomest young man, and his billet blazed up highest of all. He was the chosen one, he had the name of honour, he became &#8216;Buck of the Street!&#8217; and he chose from\\xa0<a id=\"Page_222\" name=\"Page_222\"></a>among the girls his little May-lamb. All was life and merriment, greater far than within rich Borreby Hall.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;The great lady came driving towards the Hall, in her gilded chariot drawn by six horses. She had her three dainty daughters with her; they were indeed three lovely flowers. A rose, a lily and a pale hyacinth. The mother herself was a gorgeous tulip; she took no notice whatever of the crowd, who all stopped in their game to drop their curtsies and make their bows; one might have thought that, like a tulip, she was rather frail in the stalk and feared to bend her back. The rose, the lily, and the pale hyacinth—yes, I saw them all three. Whose May-lambs were they one day to become, thought I; their mates would be proud knights—perhaps even princes!</p>\\n<p>&#8216;Whew!—whew!—fare away! Yes, the chariot bore them away, and the peasants whirled on in their dance. They played at &#8220;Riding the Summer into the village,&#8221; to Borreby village, Tareby village, and many others.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;But that night when I rose,&#8217; said the wind, &#8216;the noble lady laid herself down to rise no more; that came to her which comes to every one—there was nothing new about it. Waldemar Daa stood grave and silent for a time; &#8220;The proudest tree may bend, but it does not break,&#8221; said something within him. The daughters wept, and every one else at the Castle was wiping their eyes; but Madam Daa had fared away, and I fared away too! Whew!—whew!&#8217; said the wind.</p>\\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2078\" src=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind.jpg\" alt=\"wind\" width=\"350\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind.jpg 350w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind-150x189.jpg 150w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind-100x126.jpg 100w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind-63x80.jpg 63w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /><br />\\n&#8216;The chopping and the sawing went on—the three-decker\\xa0<a id=\"Page_228\" name=\"Page_228\"></a>was built. The master builder was a man of humble origin, but of noble loyalty; great power lay in his eyes and on his forehead, and Waldemar Daa liked to listen to him, and little Ida liked to listen too, the eldest fifteen-year-old daughter. But whilst he built the ship for her father, he built a castle in the air for himself, in which he and little Ida sat side by side as man and wife. This might also have happened if his castle had been built of solid stone, with moat and ramparts, wood and gardens. But with all his wisdom the shipbuilder was only a poor bird, and what business has a sparrow in a crane&#8217;s nest? Whew! whew! I rushed away, and he rushed away, for he dared not stay, and little Ida got over it, as get over it she must.<a id=\"Page_227\" name=\"Page_227\"></a>&#8216;I came back again; I often came back across the island of Funen and the waters of the Belt, and took up my place on Borreby shore close to the great forest of oaks. The ospreys and the wood pigeons used to build in it, the blue raven and even the black stork! It was early in the year; some of the nests were full of eggs, while in others the young ones were just hatched. What a flying and screaming was there! Then came the sound of the axe, blow upon blow; the forest was to be felled. Waldemar Daa was about to build a costly ship, a three-decked man-of-war, which it was expected the king would buy. So the wood fell, the ancient landmark of the seaman, the home of the birds. The shrike was frightened away; its nest was torn down; the osprey and all the other birds lost their nests too, and they flew about distractedly, shrieking in their terror and anger. The crows and the jackdaws screamed in mockery, Caw! caw! Waldemar Daa and his three daughters stood in the middle of the wood among the workmen. They all laughed at the wild cries of the birds, except Anna Dorothea, who was touched by their distress, and when they were about to fell a tree which was half-dead, and on whose naked branches a black stork had built its nest, out of which the young ones were sticking their heads, she begged them with tears in her eyes to spare it. So the tree with the black stork&#8217;s nest was allowed to stand. It was only a little thing.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;The fiery black horses stood neighing in the stables; they were worth looking at, and they were looked at to some purpose too. An admiral was sent from the King to look at the new man-of-war, with a view to purchasing it. The admiral was loud in his admiration of the horses. I heard all he said,&#8217; added the wind. &#8216;I went through the open door with the gentlemen and scattered the straw like gold before their feet. Waldemar Daa wanted gold; the admiral wanted the black horses, and so he praised them as he did; but his hints were not taken, therefore the ship remained unsold. There it stood by the shore covered up with boards, like a Noah&#8217;s Ark which never reached the water. Whew! whew! get along! get along! It was a miserable business. In the winter, when the fields were covered with snow and the Belt was full of\\xa0<a id=\"Page_229\" name=\"Page_229\"></a>ice-floes which I drove up on to the coast,&#8217; said the wind, &#8216;the ravens and crows came in flocks, the one blacker than the other, and perched upon the desolate, dead ship by the shore. They screamed themselves hoarse about the forest which had disappeared, and the many precious birds&#8217; nests which had been devastated, leaving old and young homeless; and all for the sake of this old piece of lumber, the proud ship which was never to touch the water! I whirled the snow about till it lay in great heaps round the ship. I let it hear my voice, and all that a storm has to say, I know that I did my best to give it an idea of the sea. Whew! whew!&#8217;</p>\\n<p>&#8216;The winter passed by; winter and summer passed away! They come and go just as I do. The snow-flakes, the apple blossom, and the leaves fall, each in their turn. Whew! whew! they pass away, as men pass too!</p>\\n<p>&#8216;The daughters were still young. Little Ida, the rose, as lovely to look at as when the shipbuilder turned his gaze upon her. I often took hold of her long brown hair when she stood lost in thought by the apple-tree in the garden. She never noticed that I showered apple-blossom over her loosened hair; she only gazed at the red sunset against the golden background of the sky, and the dark trees and bushes of the garden. Her sister Johanna was like a tall, stately lily; she held herself as stiffly erect as her mother, and seemed to have the same dread of bending her stem. She liked to walk in the long gallery where the family portraits hung. The\\xa0<a id=\"Page_230\" name=\"Page_230\"></a>ladies were painted in velvet and silk, with tiny pearl embroidered caps on their braided tresses. Their husbands were all clad in steel, or in costly cloaks lined with squirrel skins and stiff blue ruffs; their swords hung loosely by their sides. Where would Johanna&#8217;s portrait one day hang on these walls? What would her noble husband look like? These were her thoughts, and she even spoke them aloud; I heard her as I swept through the long corridor into the gallery, where I veered round again.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth, was only a child of fourteen, quiet and thoughtful. Her large blue eyes, as clear as water, were very solemn, but childhood&#8217;s smile still played upon her lips; I could not blow it away, nor did I wish to do so. I used to meet her in the garden, the ravine, and in the manor fields. She was always picking flowers and herbs, those she knew her father could use for healing drinks and potions. Waldemar Daa was proud and conceited, but he was also learned, and he knew a great deal about many things. One could see that, and many whispers went about as to his learning. The fire blazed in his stove even in summer, and his chamber door was locked. This went on for days and nights, but he did not talk much about it. One must deal silently with the forces of nature. He would soon discover the best of everything, the red, red gold!</p>\\n<p>&#8216;This was why his chimney flamed and smoked and sparkled. Yes, I was there, too,&#8217; said the wind.</p>\\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2079\" src=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind2.jpg\" alt=\"wind2\" width=\"350\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind2.jpg 350w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind2-150x188.jpg 150w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind2-100x125.jpg 100w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind2-63x79.jpg 63w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /></p>\\n<p>&#8216;The fiery steeds in the stable, where were they? The old gold and silver plate in cupboard and chest, where was that? The cattle, the land, the castle itself? Yes, they could all be melted down in the crucible, but yet no gold would come.<a id=\"Page_235\" name=\"Page_235\"></a>&#8216;Away with you, away! I sang in the back of the chimney. Smoke smoke, embers and ashes, that is all it will come to! You will burn yourself up in it. Whew! whew! away with it! But Waldemar Daa could not let it go.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;Barn and larder got emptier and emptier. Fewer servants; more mice. One pane of glass got broken and another followed it. There was no need for me to go in by the doors,&#8217; said the wind. &#8216;A smoking chimney means a cooking meal, but the only chimney which smoked here swallowed up all the meals, all for the sake of the red gold.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;I blew through the castle gate like a watchman blowing his horn, but there was no watchman,&#8217; said the wind. &#8216;I twisted round the weather-cock on the tower and it creaked as if the watchman up there was snoring, only there was no watchman. Rats and mice were the only inhabitants. Poverty laid the table; poverty lurked in wardrobe and larder. The doors fell off their hinges, cracks and crannies appeared everywhere; I went in and out,&#8217; said the wind, &#8216;so I know all about it.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;The hair and the beard of Waldemar Daa grew grey, in the sorrow of his sleepless nights, amid smoke and ashes. His skin\\xa0<a id=\"Page_236\" name=\"Page_236\"></a>grew grimy and yellow, and his eyes greedy for gold, the long expected gold.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;I whistled through the broken panes and fissures; I blew into the daughters&#8217; chests where their clothes lay faded and threadbare; they had to last for ever. A song like this had never been sung over the cradles of these children. A lordly life became a woeful life! I was the only one to sing in the castle now,&#8217; said the wind. &#8216;I snowed them up, for they said it gave warmth. They had no firewood, for the forest was cut down where they should have got it. There was a biting frost. Even I had to keep rushing through the crannies and passages to keep myself lively. They stayed in bed to keep themselves warm, those noble ladies. Their father crept about under a fur rug. Nothing to bite, and nothing to burn! a lordly life indeed! Whew! whew! let it go! But this was what Waldemar Daa could not do.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;&#8221;After winter comes the spring,&#8221; said he; &#8220;a good time will come after a time of need; but they make us wait their pleasure, wait! The castle is mortgaged, we are in extremities—and yet the gold will come—at Easter!&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8216;I heard him murmur to the spider&#8217;s web.—&#8221;You clever little weaver! You teach me to persevere! If your web is broken, you begin at the beginning again and complete it! Broken again—and cheerfully you begin it over again. That is what one must do, and one will be rewarded!&#8221;<a id=\"Page_237\" name=\"Page_237\"></a></p>\\n<p>&#8216;It was Easter morning, the bells were ringing, and the sun was at play in the heavens. Waldemar Daa had watched through the night with his blood at fever pitch; boiling and cooling, mixing and distilling. I heard him sigh like a despairing soul; I heard him pray, and I felt that he held his breath. The lamp had gone out, but he never noticed it; I blew up the embers and they shone upon his ashen face, which took a tinge of colour from their light; his eyes started in their sockets, they grew larger and larger, as if they would leap out.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;Look at the alchemist&#8217;s glass! something twinkles in it; it is glowing, pure and heavy. He lifted it with a trembling hand and shouted with a trembling voice: &#8220;Gold! gold!&#8221; He reeled, and I could easily have blown him over,&#8217; said the wind, &#8216;but I only blew upon the embers, and followed him to the room where his daughters sat shivering. His coat was powdered with ash, as well as his beard and his matted hair. He drew himself up to his full height and held up his precious treasure, in the fragile glass: &#8220;Found! won! gold!&#8221; he cried, stretching up his hand with the glass which glittered in the sunbeams: his hand shook, and the alchemist&#8217;s glass fell to the ground shivered into a thousand atoms. The last bubble of his welfare was shattered too. Whew! whew! fare away! and away I rushed from the goldmaker&#8217;s home.</p>\\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2080\" src=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind3.jpg\" alt=\"wind3\" width=\"350\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind3.jpg 350w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind3-150x187.jpg 150w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind3-100x125.jpg 100w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind3-63x79.jpg 63w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /><br />\\n&#8216;Ida and Ana Dorothea walked one on each side of him: Johanna turned round in the gateway, but what was the good of that? nothing could make their luck turn. She looked at the red stones of what had once been Marsk Stig&#8217;s Castle. Was she thinking of his daughters?&#8217;Late in the year, when the days were short and dark up here, and the fog envelops the red berries and bare branches with its\\xa0<a id=\"Page_238\" name=\"Page_238\"></a>cold moisture, I came along in a lively mood clearing the sky and snapping off the dead boughs. This is no great labour, it is true, yet it has to be done. Borreby Hall, the home of Waldemar Daa, was having a clean sweep of a different sort. The family enemy, Ové Ramel from Basness, appeared, holding the mortgage of the Hall and all its contents. I drummed upon the cracked window panes, beat against the decaying doors, and whistled through all the cracks and crannies, whew! I did my best to prevent Herr Ové taking a fancy to stay there. Ida and Anna Dorothea faced it bravely, although they shed some tears; Johanna stood pale and erect and bit her finger till it bled! Much that would help her! Ové Ramel offered to let them stay on at the Castle for Waldemar Daa&#8217;s lifetime, but he got no thanks for his offer; I was listening. I saw the ruined gentleman stiffen his neck and hold his head higher than ever. I beat against the walls and the old linden trees with such force that the thickest branch broke, although it was not a bit rotten. It fell across the gate like a broom, as if some one was about to sweep; and a sweeping there was indeed to be. I quite expected it. It was a grievous day and a hard time for them, but their wills were as stubborn as their necks were stiff. They had not a possession in the world but the clothes on their backs; yes, one thing—an alchemist&#8217;s glass which had been bought and filled with the fragments scraped up from the floor. The treasure which promised much and fulfilled nothing.\\xa0<a id=\"Page_243\" name=\"Page_243\"></a>Waldemar Daa hid it in his bosom, took his staff in his hand, and, with his three daughters, the once wealthy gentleman walked out of Borreby Hall for the last time. I blew a cold blast upon his burning cheeks, I fluttered his grey beard and his long white hair; I sang such a tune as only I could sing. Whew! whew! away with them! away with them! This was the end of all their grandeur.</p>\\n<div class=\"poem\">\\n<div class=\"stanza\"><span class=\"i0\">&#8216;&#8221;The elder took the younger by the hand,</span><span class=\"i0\">And out they roamed to a far-off land.&#8221;</span></div>\\n</div>\\n<p>Was she thinking of that song? Here there were three and their father was with them. They walked along the road where once they used to ride in their chariot. They trod it now as vagrants, on their way to a plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, which was rented at ten marks yearly. This was their new country seat with its empty walls and its empty vessels. The crows and the magpies wheeled screaming over their heads with their mocking &#8220;Caw, caw! Out of the nest, Caw, caw!&#8221; just as they screamed in Borreby Forest when the trees were felled.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;Herr Daa and his daughters must have noticed it. I blew\\xa0<a id=\"Page_244\" name=\"Page_244\"></a>into their ears to try and deaden the cries, which after all were not worth listening to.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;So they took up their abode in the plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, and I tore off over marshes and meadows, through naked hedges and bare woods, to the open seas and other lands. Whew! whew! away, away! and that for many years.&#8217;</p>\\n<p>What happened to Waldemar Daa? What happened to his daughters? This is what the wind relates.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;The last of them I saw, yes, for the last time, was Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth. She was old and bent now; it was half a century later. She lived the longest, she had gone through everything.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;Across the heath, near the town of Viborg, stood the Dean&#8217;s new, handsome mansion, built of red stone with toothed gables. The smoke curled thickly out of the chimneys. The gentle lady and her fair daughters sat in the bay window looking into the garden at the drooping thorns and out to the brown heath beyond. What were they looking at there? They were looking at a stork&#8217;s nest on a tumble-down cottage; the roof was covered, as far as there was any roof to cover, with moss and house-leek; but the stork&#8217;s nest made the best covering. It was the only part to which anything was done, for the stork kept it in repair.</p>\\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2081\" src=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind5.jpg\" alt=\"wind5\" width=\"350\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind5.jpg 350w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind5-150x188.jpg 150w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind5-100x125.jpg 100w, https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wind5-63x79.jpg 63w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /></p>\\n<p>&#8216;Oh dear! oh dear! No bells rang over the grave of Waldemar Daa. No schoolboys sang when the former lord of Borreby Castle was laid in his grave. Well, everything must have an end, even misery! Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant, and this was her father&#8217;s sorest trial. His daughter&#8217;s husband a miserable serf, who might at any moment be ordered the punishment of the wooden horse by his lord. It is well that the sod covers him now, and you too, Ida! Ah yes! ah yes! Poor me! poor me! I still linger on. In Thy mercy release me, O Christ!&#8221;This house was only fit to be looked at, not to be touched. I had to mind what I was about,&#8217; said the wind. &#8216;The cottage\\xa0<a id=\"Page_249\" name=\"Page_249\"></a>was allowed to stand for the sake of the stork&#8217;s nest; in itself it was only a scarecrow on the heath, but the dean did not want to frighten away the stork, so the hovel was allowed to stand. The poor soul inside was allowed to live in it; she had the Egyptian bird to thank for that; or was it payment for once having pleaded for the nest of his wild black brother in the Borreby Forest? Then, poor thing, she was a child, a delicate, pale hyacinth in a noble flower-garden. Poor Anna Dorothea; she remembered it all! Ah, human beings can sigh as well as the wind when it soughs through the rushes and reeds.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;This was the prayer of Anna Dorothea, as she lay in the miserable hovel which was only left standing for the sake of the stork.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;I took charge of the boldest of the sisters,&#8217; said the wind. &#8216;She had clothes made to suit her manly disposition, and took a\\xa0<a id=\"Page_250\" name=\"Page_250\"></a>place as a lad with a skipper. Her words were few and looks stubborn, but she was willing enough at her work. But with all her will she could not climb the rigging; so I blew her overboard before any one discovered that she was a woman, and I fancy that was not a bad deed of mine!&#8217; said the wind.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;On such an Easter morning as that on which Waldemar Daa thought he had found the red gold, I heard from beneath the stork&#8217;s nest a psalm echoing through the miserable walls. It was Anna Dorothea&#8217;s last song. There was no window; only a hole in the wall. The sun rose in splendour and poured in upon her; her eyes were glazed and her heart broken! This would have been so this morning whether the sun had shone upon her or not. The stork kept a roof over her head till her death! I sang at her grave,&#8217; said the wind, &#8216;and I sang at her father&#8217;s grave. I know where it is, and hers too, which is more than any one else knows.</p>\\n<p>&#8216;The old order changeth, giving place to the new. The old high-road now only leads to cultivated fields, while peaceful graves are covered by busy traffic on the new road. Soon comes Steam with its row of waggons behind it, rushing over the graves, forgotten, like the names upon them. Whew! whew! Let us be gone! This is the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters. Tell it better yourselves, if you can,&#8217; said the wind, as it veered round. Then it was gone.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"review\" class=\"comments-area\">\\n<h6 class=\"margin50\">Book Reviews (10)</h6>\\n<ol class=\"comment-list\">\\n<li id=\"comment-10475\" class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\">\\n<article id=\"div-comment-10475\" class=\"comment-body\">\\n<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\\n<img alt=\\'\\' src=\\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bf737a039338f69dc6b0472b65233eb0?s=32&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g\\' srcset=\\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bf737a039338f69dc6b0472b65233eb0?s=64&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\\' class=\\'avatar avatar-32 photo\\' height=\\'32\\' width=\\'32\\' />\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<b class=\"fn\">Ashish</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\\n<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\\n<a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/2020/05/18/the-winds-tale/#comment-10475\">\\n<time datetime=\"2020-07-09T16:01:55+00:00\">\\nJuly 9, 2020 at 4:01 pm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</time>\\n</a>\\n</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\\n</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\\n<div class=\"comment-content\">\\n<p>Very nice book\\n<div itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\" class=\"rating inline-block margin20\"><i class=\"ion-android-star starred\"></i><i class=\"ion-android-star starred\"></i><i class=\"ion-android-star starred\"></i><i class=\"ion-android-star starred\"></i><i class=\"ion-android-star starred\"></i><meta itemprop=\"ratingValue\" content=\"5\"/><meta itemprop=\"bestRating\" content=\"5\"/></div>\\n</div><!-- .comment-content -->\\n<div class=\"reply\"><a rel=\\'nofollow\\' class=\\'comment-reply-link\\' href=\\'https://www.studentuk.com/2020/05/18/the-winds-tale/?replytocom=10475#respond\\' onclick=\\'return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-10475\", \"10475\", \"respond\", \"2077\" )\\' aria-label=\\'Reply to Ashish\\'>Reply</a></div>\\t\\t\\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\\n<li id=\"comment-10476\" class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\">\\n<article id=\"div-comment-10476\" class=\"comment-body\">\\n<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\\n<img alt=\\'\\' src=\\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d32779b6bed1dadbe951a1600d30a56f?s=32&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g\\' srcset=\\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d32779b6bed1dadbe951a1600d30a56f?s=64&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\\' class=\\'avatar avatar-32 photo\\' height=\\'32\\' width=\\'32\\' />\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<b class=\"fn\">Shauryaraj.

              "<p class=\"drop-cap\"><span class=\"smcap1\">There</span> was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter of a mighty King. She was called Maid Maleen, and was very beautiful. As her father wished to give her to another, the Prince was rejected.</p>\n",
              "<p>But since they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would not give each other up, and Maid Maleen said to her father, “I can and will take no other for my husband.”</p>\n",
              "<p>Then the King flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter. When it was finished, he said, “Therein shall you be imprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if your perverse spirit is broken.”</p>\n",
              "<p>Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower; and then she and her waiting-woman were led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and from the earth. There they sat in the darkness, and knew not when day or night began. The King’s Son often went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound from without pierced through the thick walls. What else could they do but lament and complain?</p>\n",
              "<p>Meanwhile, the time passed, and by the small amount of food and drink left they knew that the seven years were coming to an end. They thought the moment of their deliverance was come. But no stroke of the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to Maid Maleen that her father had forgotten her. As they had food for only a short time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, Maid Maleen said, “We must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall.”</p>\n",
              "<p>She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn. With great labor they succeeded in getting out one stone, then a second, and third. And when three days were over, the first ray of light fell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could look out.</p>\n",
              "<p>The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces; but how melancholy everything looked all around! Her father’s castle lay in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible.</p>\n",
              "<p>When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed. But where were they to go? The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven away the King, and slain all the inhabitants. They wandered forth to seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread. Their need was so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with nettle-plants.</p>\n",
              "<p>When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried to get work everywhere. But wherever they knocked they were turned away, and no one would have pity on them.</p>\n",
              "<p>At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace. There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions.</p>\n",
              "<p>The King’s Son in whose kingdom they were, was, however, the very man who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen. His father had chosen another Bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked. The wedding was fixed, and the girl had already arrived. Because of her great ugliness, however, she shut herself in her room, and allowed no one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the kitchen.</p>\n",
              "<p>When the day came for the Bride and the Bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people. Then said she to Maid Maleen, “A great piece of luck has befallen you. I have sprained my foot, and cannot walk through the streets. You shall put on my wedding-clothes and take my place. A greater honor than that you cannot have!”</p>\n",
              "<p>Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, “I wish for no honor which is not suitable for me.”</p>\n",

              "'When the wind sweeps across a field of grass it makes little ripples in it like a lake; in a field of corn it makes great waves like the sea itself: this is the wind’s frolic. Then listen to the stories it tells; it sings them aloud, one kind of song among the trees of the forest, and a very different one when it is pent up within walls with all their cracks and crannies. Do you see how the wind chases the white fleecy clouds as if they were a flock of sheep? Do you hear the wind down there, howling in the open doorway like a watchman winding his horn? Then, too, how he whistles in the chimneys, making the fire crackle and sparkle. How cosy it is to sit in the warm glow of the fire listening to the tales it has to tell! Let the wind tell its own story! It can tell you more adventures than all of us put together. Listen now:—‘Whew!—Whew!—Fare away!’ That was the refrain of his song.‘Close to the Great Belt stands an old mansion with thick red walls,’ says the wind. ‘I know every stone of it; I knew them before when they formed part of Marsk Stig’s Castle on the Ness. It had to come down. The stones were used again, and made a new wall of a new castle in another place—Borreby Hall as it now stands.‘I have watched the highborn men and women of all the various races who have lived there, and now I am going to tell you about Waldemar Daa and his daughters!‘He held his head very high, for he came of a royal stock! He knew more than the mere chasing of a stag, or the emptying of a flagon; he knew how to manage his affairs, he said himself.‘His lady wife walked proudly across the brightly polished floors, in her gold brocaded kirtle; the tapestries in the rooms were gorgeous, and the furniture of costly carved woods. She had brought much gold and silver plate into the house with her, and the cellars were full of German ale, when there was anything there at all. Fiery black horses neighed in the stables; Borreby Hall was a very rich place when wealth came there.‘Then there were the children, three dainty maidens, Ida, Johanna and Anna Dorothea. I remember their names well.‘They were rich and aristocratic people, and they were born and bred in wealth! Whew!—whew!—fare away!’ roared the wind, then he went on with his story.‘I did not see here, as in other old noble castles the highborn lady sitting among her maidens in the great hall turning the spinning-wheel. No, she played upon the ringing lute, and sang to its tones. Her songs were not always the old Danish ditties, however, but songs in foreign tongues. All was life and hospitality; noble guests came from far and wide; there were sounds of music and the clanging of flagons, so loud that I could not drown them!’ said the wind. ‘Here were arrogance and ostentation enough and to spare; plenty of lords, but the Lord had no place there.‘Then came the evening of May-day!’ said the wind. ‘I came from the west; I had been watching ships being wrecked and broken up on the west coast of Jutland. I tore over the heaths and the green wooded coasts, across the island of Funen and over the Great Belt puffing and blowing. I settled down to rest on the coast of Zealand close to Borreby Hall, where the splendid forest of oaks still stood. The young bachelors of the neighbourhood came out and collected faggots and branches, the longest and driest they could find. These they took to the town, piled them up in a heap, and set fire to them; then the men and maidens danced and sang round the bonfire. I lay still,’ said the wind, ‘but I softly moved a branch, the one laid by the handsomest young man, and his billet blazed up highest of all. He was the chosen one, he had the name of honour, he became ‘Buck of the Street!’ and he chose from\\xa0among the girls his little May-lamb. All was life and merriment, greater far than within rich Borreby Hall.‘The great lady came driving towards the Hall, in her gilded chariot drawn by six horses. She had her three dainty daughters with her; they were indeed three lovely flowers. A rose, a lily and a pale hyacinth. The mother herself was a gorgeous tulip; she took no notice whatever of the crowd, who all stopped in their game to drop their curtsies and make their bows; one might have thought that, like a tulip, she was rather frail in the stalk and feared to bend her back. The rose, the lily, and the pale hyacinth—yes, I saw them all three. Whose May-lambs were they one day to become, thought I; their mates would be proud knights—perhaps even princes!‘Whew!—whew!—fare away! Yes, the chariot bore them away, and the peasants whirled on in their dance. They played at “Riding the Summer into the village,” to Borreby village, Tareby village, and many others.‘But that night when I rose,’ said the wind, ‘the noble lady laid herself down to rise no more; that came to her which comes to every one—there was nothing new about it. Waldemar Daa stood grave and silent for a time; “The proudest tree may bend, but it does not break,” said something within him. The daughters wept, and every one else at the Castle was wiping their eyes; but Madam Daa had fared away, and I fared away too! Whew!—whew!’ said the wind.\\n‘The chopping and the sawing went on—the three-decker\\xa0was built. The master builder was a man of humble origin, but of noble loyalty; great power lay in his eyes and on his forehead, and Waldemar Daa liked to listen to him, and little Ida liked to listen too, the eldest fifteen-year-old daughter. But whilst he built the ship for her father, he built a castle in the air for himself, in which he and little Ida sat side by side as man and wife. This might also have happened if his castle had been built of solid stone, with moat and ramparts, wood and gardens. But with all his wisdom the shipbuilder was only a poor bird, and what business has a sparrow in a crane’s nest? Whew! whew! I rushed away, and he rushed away, for he dared not stay, and little Ida got over it, as get over it she must.‘I came back again; I often came back across the island of Funen and the waters of the Belt, and took up my place on Borreby shore close to the great forest of oaks. The ospreys and the wood pigeons used to build in it, the blue raven and even the black stork! It was early in the year; some of the nests were full of eggs, while in others the young ones were just hatched. What a flying and screaming was there! Then came the sound of the axe, blow upon blow; the forest was to be felled. Waldemar Daa was about to build a costly ship, a three-decked man-of-war, which it was expected the king would buy. So the wood fell, the ancient landmark of the seaman, the home of the birds. The shrike was frightened away; its nest was torn down; the osprey and all the other birds lost their nests too, and they flew about distractedly, shrieking in their terror and anger. The crows and the jackdaws screamed in mockery, Caw! caw! Waldemar Daa and his three daughters stood in the middle of the wood among the workmen. They all laughed at the wild cries of the birds, except Anna Dorothea, who was touched by their distress, and when they were about to fell a tree which was half-dead, and on whose naked branches a black stork had built its nest, out of which the young ones were sticking their heads, she begged them with tears in her eyes to spare it. So the tree with the black stork’s nest was allowed to stand. It was only a little thing.‘The fiery black horses stood neighing in the stables; they were worth looking at, and they were looked at to some purpose too. An admiral was sent from the King to look at the new man-of-war, with a view to purchasing it. The admiral was loud in his admiration of the horses. I heard all he said,’ added the wind. ‘I went through the open door with the gentlemen and scattered the straw like gold before their feet. Waldemar Daa wanted gold; the admiral wanted the black horses, and so he praised them as he did; but his hints were not taken, therefore the ship remained unsold. There it stood by the shore covered up with boards, like a Noah’s Ark which never reached the water. Whew! whew! get along! get along! It was a miserable business. In the winter, when the fields were covered with snow and the Belt was full of\\xa0ice-floes which I drove up on to the coast,’ said the wind, ‘the ravens and crows came in flocks, the one blacker than the other, and perched upon the desolate, dead ship by the shore. They screamed themselves hoarse about the forest which had disappeared, and the many precious birds’ nests which had been devastated, leaving old and young homeless; and all for the sake of this old piece of lumber, the proud ship which was never to touch the water! I whirled the snow about till it lay in great heaps round the ship. I let it hear my voice, and all that a storm has to say, I know that I did my best to give it an idea of the sea. Whew! whew!’‘The winter passed by; winter and summer passed away! They come and go just as I do. The snow-flakes, the apple blossom, and the leaves fall, each in their turn. Whew! whew! they pass away, as men pass too!‘The daughters were still young. Little Ida, the rose, as lovely to look at as when the shipbuilder turned his gaze upon her. I often took hold of her long brown hair when she stood lost in thought by the apple-tree in the garden. She never noticed that I showered apple-blossom over her loosened hair; she only gazed at the red sunset against the golden background of the sky, and the dark trees and bushes of the garden. Her sister Johanna was like a tall, stately lily; she held herself as stiffly erect as her mother, and seemed to have the same dread of bending her stem. She liked to walk in the long gallery where the family portraits hung. The\\xa0ladies were painted in velvet and silk, with tiny pearl embroidered caps on their braided tresses. Their husbands were all clad in steel, or in costly cloaks lined with squirrel skins and stiff blue ruffs; their swords hung loosely by their sides. Where would Johanna’s portrait one day hang on these walls? What would her noble husband look like? These were her thoughts, and she even spoke them aloud; I heard her as I swept through the long corridor into the gallery, where I veered round again.‘Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth, was only a child of fourteen, quiet and thoughtful. Her large blue eyes, as clear as water, were very solemn, but childhood’s smile still played upon her lips; I could not blow it away, nor did I wish to do so. I used to meet her in the garden, the ravine, and in the manor fields. She was always picking flowers and herbs, those she knew her father could use for healing drinks and potions. Waldemar Daa was proud and conceited, but he was also learned, and he knew a great deal about many things. One could see that, and many whispers went about as to his learning. The fire blazed in his stove even in summer, and his chamber door was locked. This went on for days and nights, but he did not talk much about it. One must deal silently with the forces of nature. He would soon discover the best of everything, the red, red gold!‘This was why his chimney flamed and smoked and sparkled. Yes, I was there, too,’ said the wind.‘The fiery steeds in the stable, where were they? The old gold and silver plate in cupboard and chest, where was that? The cattle, the land, the castle itself? Yes, they could all be melted down in the crucible, but yet no gold would come.‘Away with you, away! I sang in the back of the chimney. Smoke smoke, embers and ashes, that is all it will come to! You will burn yourself up in it. Whew! whew! away with it! But Waldemar Daa could not let it go.‘Barn and larder got emptier and emptier. Fewer servants; more mice. One pane of glass got broken and another followed it. There was no need for me to go in by the doors,’ said the wind. ‘A smoking chimney means a cooking meal, but the only chimney which smoked here swallowed up all the meals, all for the sake of the red gold.‘I blew through the castle gate like a watchman blowing his horn, but there was no watchman,’ said the wind. ‘I twisted round the weather-cock on the tower and it creaked as if the watchman up there was snoring, only there was no watchman. Rats and mice were the only inhabitants. Poverty laid the table; poverty lurked in wardrobe and larder. The doors fell off their hinges, cracks and crannies appeared everywhere; I went in and out,’ said the wind, ‘so I know all about it.‘The hair and the beard of Waldemar Daa grew grey, in the sorrow of his sleepless nights, amid smoke and ashes. His skin\\xa0grew grimy and yellow, and his eyes greedy for gold, the long expected gold.‘I whistled through the broken panes and fissures; I blew into the daughters’ chests where their clothes lay faded and threadbare; they had to last for ever. A song like this had never been sung over the cradles of these children. A lordly life became a woeful life! I was the only one to sing in the castle now,’ said the wind. ‘I snowed them up, for they said it gave warmth. They had no firewood, for the forest was cut down where they should have got it. There was a biting frost. Even I had to keep rushing through the crannies and passages to keep myself lively. They stayed in bed to keep themselves warm, those noble ladies. Their father crept about under a fur rug. Nothing to bite, and nothing to burn! a lordly life indeed! Whew! whew! let it go! But this was what Waldemar Daa could not do.‘”After winter comes the spring,” said he; “a good time will come after a time of need; but they make us wait their pleasure, wait! The castle is mortgaged, we are in extremities—and yet the gold will come—at Easter!”‘I heard him murmur to the spider’s web.—”You clever little weaver! You teach me to persevere! If your web is broken, you begin at the beginning again and complete it! Broken again—and cheerfully you begin it over again. That is what one must do, and one will be rewarded!”‘It was Easter morning, the bells were ringing, and the sun was at play in the heavens. Waldemar Daa had watched through the night with his blood at fever pitch; boiling and cooling, mixing and distilling. I heard him sigh like a despairing soul; I heard him pray, and I felt that he held his breath. The lamp had gone out, but he never noticed it; I blew up the embers and they shone upon his ashen face, which took a tinge of colour from their light; his eyes started in their sockets, they grew larger and larger, as if they would leap out.‘Look at the alchemist’s glass! something twinkles in it; it is glowing, pure and heavy. He lifted it with a trembling hand and shouted with a trembling voice: “Gold! gold!” He reeled, and I could easily have blown him over,’ said the wind, ‘but I only blew upon the embers, and followed him to the room where his daughters sat shivering. His coat was powdered with ash, as well as his beard and his matted hair. He drew himself up to his full height and held up his precious treasure, in the fragile glass: “Found! won! gold!” he cried, stretching up his hand with the glass which glittered in the sunbeams: his hand shook, and the alchemist’s glass fell to the ground shivered into a thousand atoms. The last bubble of his welfare was shattered too. Whew! whew! fare away! and away I rushed from the goldmaker’s home.\\n‘Ida and Ana Dorothea walked one on each side of him: Johanna turned round in the gateway, but what was the good of that? nothing could make their luck turn. She looked at the red stones of what had once been Marsk Stig’s Castle. Was she thinking of his daughters?’Late in the year, when the days were short and dark up here, and the fog envelops the red berries and bare branches with its\\xa0cold moisture, I came along in a lively mood clearing the sky and snapping off the dead boughs. This is no great labour, it is true, yet it has to be done. Borreby Hall, the home of Waldemar Daa, was having a clean sweep of a different sort. The family enemy, Ové Ramel from Basness, appeared, holding the mortgage of the Hall and all its contents. I drummed upon the cracked window panes, beat against the decaying doors, and whistled through all the cracks and crannies, whew! I did my best to prevent Herr Ové taking a fancy to stay there. Ida and Anna Dorothea faced it bravely, although they shed some tears; Johanna stood pale and erect and bit her finger till it bled! Much that would help her! Ové Ramel offered to let them stay on at the Castle for Waldemar Daa’s lifetime, but he got no thanks for his offer; I was listening. I saw the ruined gentleman stiffen his neck and hold his head higher than ever. I beat against the walls and the old linden trees with such force that the thickest branch broke, although it was not a bit rotten. It fell across the gate like a broom, as if some one was about to sweep; and a sweeping there was indeed to be. I quite expected it. It was a grievous day and a hard time for them, but their wills were as stubborn as their necks were stiff. They had not a possession in the world but the clothes on their backs; yes, one thing—an alchemist’s glass which had been bought and filled with the fragments scraped up from the floor. The treasure which promised much and fulfilled nothing.\\xa0Waldemar Daa hid it in his bosom, took his staff in his hand, and, with his three daughters, the once wealthy gentleman walked out of Borreby Hall for the last time. I blew a cold blast upon his burning cheeks, I fluttered his grey beard and his long white hair; I sang such a tune as only I could sing. Whew! whew! away with them! away with them! This was the end of all their grandeur.Was she thinking of that song? Here there were three and their father was with them. They walked along the road where once they used to ride in their chariot. They trod it now as vagrants, on their way to a plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, which was rented at ten marks yearly. This was their new country seat with its empty walls and its empty vessels. The crows and the magpies wheeled screaming over their heads with their mocking “Caw, caw! Out of the nest, Caw, caw!” just as they screamed in Borreby Forest when the trees were felled.‘Herr Daa and his daughters must have noticed it. I blew\\xa0into their ears to try and deaden the cries, which after all were not worth listening to.‘So they took up their abode in the plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, and I tore off over marshes and meadows, through naked hedges and bare woods, to the open seas and other lands. Whew! whew! away, away! and that for many years.’What happened to Waldemar Daa? What happened to his daughters? This is what the wind relates.‘The last of them I saw, yes, for the last time, was Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth. She was old and bent now; it was half a century later. She lived the longest, she had gone through everything.‘Across the heath, near the town of Viborg, stood the Dean’s new, handsome mansion, built of red stone with toothed gables. The smoke curled thickly out of the chimneys. The gentle lady and her fair daughters sat in the bay window looking into the garden at the drooping thorns and out to the brown heath beyond. What were they looking at there? They were looking at a stork’s nest on a tumble-down cottage; the roof was covered, as far as there was any roof to cover, with moss and house-leek; but the stork’s nest made the best covering. It was the only part to which anything was done, for the stork kept it in repair.‘Oh dear! oh dear! No bells rang over the grave of Waldemar Daa. No schoolboys sang when the former lord of Borreby Castle was laid in his grave. Well, everything must have an end, even misery! Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant, and this was her father’s sorest trial. His daughter’s husband a miserable serf, who might at any moment be ordered the punishment of the wooden horse by his lord. It is well that the sod covers him now, and you too, Ida! Ah yes! ah yes! Poor me! poor me! I still linger on. In Thy mercy release me, O Christ!”This house was only fit to be looked at, not to be touched. I had to mind what I was about,’ said the wind. ‘The cottage\\xa0was allowed to stand for the sake of the stork’s nest; in itself it was only a scarecrow on the heath, but the dean did not want to frighten away the stork, so the hovel was allowed to stand. The poor soul inside was allowed to live in it; she had the Egyptian bird to thank for that; or was it payment for once having pleaded for the nest of his wild black brother in the Borreby Forest? Then, poor thing, she was a child, a delicate, pale hyacinth in a noble flower-garden. Poor Anna Dorothea; she remembered it all! Ah, human beings can sigh as well as the wind when it soughs through the rushes and reeds.‘This was the prayer of Anna Dorothea, as she lay in the miserable hovel which was only left standing for the sake of the stork.‘I took charge of the boldest of the sisters,’ said the wind. ‘She had clothes made to suit her manly disposition, and took a\\xa0place as a lad with a skipper. Her words were few and looks stubborn, but she was willing enough at her work. But with all her will she could not climb the rigging; so I blew her overboard before any one discovered that she was a woman, and I fancy that was not a bad deed of mine!’ said the wind.‘On such an Easter morning as that on which Waldemar Daa thought he had found the red gold, I heard from beneath the stork’s nest a psalm echoing through the miserable walls. It was Anna Dorothea’s last song. There was no window; only a hole in the wall. The sun rose in splendour and poured in upon her; her eyes were glazed and her heart broken! This would have been so this morning whether the sun had shone upon her or not. The stork kept a roof over her head till her death! I sang at her grave,’ said the wind, ‘and I sang at her father’s grave. I know where it is, and hers too, which is more than any one else knows.‘The old order changeth, giving place to the new. The old high-road now only leads to cultivated fields, while peaceful graves are covered by busy traffic on the new road. Soon comes Steam with its row of waggons behind it, rushing over the graves, forgotten, like the names upon them. Whew! whew! Let us be gone! This is the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters. Tell it better yourselves, if you can,’ said the wind, as it veered round. Then it was gone.'"

              "('Maid Maleen',\n",
              " 'There\\xa0was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter of a mighty King. She was called Maid Maleen, and was very beautiful. As her father wished to give her to another, the Prince was rejected.But since they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would not give each other up, and Maid Maleen said to her father, “I can and will take no other for my husband.”Then the King flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter. When it was finished, he said, “Therein shall you be imprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if your perverse spirit is broken.”Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower; and then she and her waiting-woman were led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and from the earth. There they sat in the darkness, and knew not when day or night began. The King’s Son often went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound from without\\xa0pierced through the thick walls. What else could they do but lament and complain?Meanwhile, the time passed, and by the small amount of food and drink left they knew that the seven years were coming to an end. They thought the moment of their deliverance was come. But no stroke of the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to Maid Maleen that her father had forgotten her. As they had food for only a short time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, Maid Maleen said, “We must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall.”She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn. With great labor they succeeded in getting out one stone, then a second, and third. And when three days were over, the first ray of light fell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could look out.The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces; but how melancholy everything looked all around! Her father’s castle lay in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible.When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed. But where were they to go? The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven away the King, and slain all the inhabitants. They wandered forth to seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread. Their need was\\xa0so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with nettle-plants.When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried to get work everywhere. But wherever they knocked they were turned away, and no one would have pity on them.At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace. There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions.The King’s Son in whose kingdom they were, was, however, the very man who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen. His father had chosen another Bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked. The wedding was fixed, and the girl had already arrived. Because of her great ugliness, however, she shut herself in her room, and allowed no one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the kitchen.When the day came for the Bride and the Bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people. Then said she to Maid Maleen, “A great piece of luck has befallen you. I have sprained my foot, and cannot walk through the streets. You shall put on my wedding-clothes and take my place. A greater honor than that you cannot have!”Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, “I wish for no honor which is not suitable for me.”It was in vain, too, that the Bride offered her gold. At last\\xa0she said angrily, “If you do not obey me, it shall cost you your life. I have but to speak the word, and your head will lie at your feet.”Then she was forced to obey, and put on the Bride’s magnificent clothes and all her jewels. When she entered the royal hall, every one was amazed at her great beauty, and the King said to his son, “This is the Bride whom I have chosen for you, and whom you must lead to church.”The Bridegroom was astonished, and thought, “She is like my Maid Maleen, and I should believe that it was she herself, but she has long been shut up in the tower or dead.”He took her by the hand and led her to church. On the way was a nettle-plant, and she said:“What are you saying?” asked the King’s Son.“Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”He was surprised that she knew about her, but kept silence. When they came to the foot-plank into the churchyard, she said:“What are you saying there?” asked the King’s Son.“Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”When they came to the church-door, she said once more:“What are you saying there?” asked he.“Ah,” she answered, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”Then he took out a precious chain, put it round her neck, and fastened the clasp. Thereupon they entered the church, and the priest joined their hands together before the altar, and married them. He led her home but she did not speak a single word the whole way.When they got back to the royal palace, she hurried into the Bride’s chamber, put off the magnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed herself in her gray gown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck, which she had received from the Bridegroom.When the night came, and the Bride was to be led into the apartment of the King’s Son, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not observe the deception.As soon as every one had gone away, he said to her, “What did you say to the nettle-plant which was growing by the wayside?”“To which nettle-plant?” asked she; “I don’t talk to nettle-plants.”“If you did not do it, then you are not the true Bride,” said he.So she bethought herself, and said:She went out and sought Maid Maleen. “Girl, what have you been saying to the nettle?”“I said nothing but:The Bride ran back into the chamber, and said, “I know now what I said to the nettle,” and she repeated the words which she had just heard.“But what did you say to the foot-bridge when we went over it?” asked the King’s Son.“To the foot-bridge?” she answered. “I don’t talk to foot-bridges.”“Then you are not the true Bride.”She again said:and ran out and found Maid Maleen. “Girl, what did you say to the foot-bridge?”“I said nothing but:“That costs you your life!” cried the Bride, but she hurried into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,” and she repeated the words.“But what did you say to the church-door?”“To the church-door?” she replied; “I don’t talk to church-doors.”“Then you are not the true Bride.”She went out and found Maid Maleen, and said, “Girl, what did you say to the church-door?”“I said nothing but:“That will break your neck for you!” cried the Bride, and flew into a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the church-door,” and she repeated the words.“But where have you the jewel which I gave you at the church-door?”“What jewel?” she answered; “you did not give me any jewel.”“I myself put it round your neck, and I myself fastened it. If you do not know that, you are not the true Bride.”He drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her ugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, “How come you here? Who are you?”“I am your betrothed Bride, but because I feared lest the people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I commanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to go to church instead of me.”“Where is the girl?” said he; “I want to see her, go and bring her here.”She went out and told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and that they must take her out into the courtyard and strike off her head.The servants laid hold of Maid Maleen and wanted to drag\\xa0her out, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the King’s Son heard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden free.Lights were brought, and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the church-door.“You are the true Bride,” said he, “who went with me to church. Come with me now to my room.”When they were both alone, he said, “On the way to the church you did name Maid Maleen, who was my betrothed Bride. If I could believe it possible, I should think she was standing before me—you are like her in every respect.”She answered, “I am Maid Maleen, who for your sake was imprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and thirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty. To-day, however, the sun is shining on me once more. I was married to you in the church, and I am your lawful wife.”Then they kissed each other, and were happy all the days of their lives.The false Bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off.The tower in which Maid Maleen had been imprisoned remained standing for a long time, and when the children passed by it, they sang:')"

              "'When the wind sweeps across a field of grass it makes little ripples in it like a lake; in a field of corn it makes great waves like the sea itself: this is the wind’s frolic. Then listen to the stories it tells; it sings them aloud, one kind of song among the trees of the forest, and a very different one when it is pent up within walls with all their cracks and crannies. Do you see how the wind chases the white fleecy clouds as if they were a flock of sheep? Do you hear the wind down there, howling in the open doorway like a watchman winding his horn? Then, too, how he whistles in the chimneys, making the fire crackle and sparkle. How cosy it is to sit in the warm glow of the fire listening to the tales it has to tell! Let the wind tell its own story! It can tell you more adventures than all of us put together. Listen now:—‘Whew!—Whew!—Fare away!’ That was the refrain of his song.‘Close to the Great Belt stands an old mansion with thick red walls,’ says the wind. ‘I know every stone of it; I knew them before when they formed part of Marsk Stig’s Castle on the Ness. It had to come down. The stones were used again, and made a new wall of a new castle in another place—Borreby Hall as it now stands.‘I have watched the highborn men and women of all the various races who have lived there, and now I am going to tell you about Waldemar Daa and his daughters!‘He held his head very high, for he came of a royal stock! He knew more than the mere chasing of a stag, or the emptying of a flagon; he knew how to manage his affairs, he said himself.‘His lady wife walked proudly across the brightly polished floors, in her gold brocaded kirtle; the tapestries in the rooms were gorgeous, and the furniture of costly carved woods. She had brought much gold and silver plate into the house with her, and the cellars were full of German ale, when there was anything there at all. Fiery black horses neighed in the stables; Borreby Hall was a very rich place when wealth came there.‘Then there were the children, three dainty maidens, Ida, Johanna and Anna Dorothea. I remember their names well.‘They were rich and aristocratic people, and they were born and bred in wealth! Whew!—whew!—fare away!’ roared the wind, then he went on with his story.‘I did not see here, as in other old noble castles the highborn lady sitting among her maidens in the great hall turning the spinning-wheel. No, she played upon the ringing lute, and sang to its tones. Her songs were not always the old Danish ditties, however, but songs in foreign tongues. All was life and hospitality; noble guests came from far and wide; there were sounds of music and the clanging of flagons, so loud that I could not drown them!’ said the wind. ‘Here were arrogance and ostentation enough and to spare; plenty of lords, but the Lord had no place there.‘Then came the evening of May-day!’ said the wind. ‘I came from the west; I had been watching ships being wrecked and broken up on the west coast of Jutland. I tore over the heaths and the green wooded coasts, across the island of Funen and over the Great Belt puffing and blowing. I settled down to rest on the coast of Zealand close to Borreby Hall, where the splendid forest of oaks still stood. The young bachelors of the neighbourhood came out and collected faggots and branches, the longest and driest they could find. These they took to the town, piled them up in a heap, and set fire to them; then the men and maidens danced and sang round the bonfire. I lay still,’ said the wind, ‘but I softly moved a branch, the one laid by the handsomest young man, and his billet blazed up highest of all. He was the chosen one, he had the name of honour, he became ‘Buck of the Street!’ and he chose from\\xa0among the girls his little May-lamb. All was life and merriment, greater far than within rich Borreby Hall.‘The great lady came driving towards the Hall, in her gilded chariot drawn by six horses. She had her three dainty daughters with her; they were indeed three lovely flowers. A rose, a lily and a pale hyacinth. The mother herself was a gorgeous tulip; she took no notice whatever of the crowd, who all stopped in their game to drop their curtsies and make their bows; one might have thought that, like a tulip, she was rather frail in the stalk and feared to bend her back. The rose, the lily, and the pale hyacinth—yes, I saw them all three. Whose May-lambs were they one day to become, thought I; their mates would be proud knights—perhaps even princes!‘Whew!—whew!—fare away! Yes, the chariot bore them away, and the peasants whirled on in their dance. They played at “Riding the Summer into the village,” to Borreby village, Tareby village, and many others.‘But that night when I rose,’ said the wind, ‘the noble lady laid herself down to rise no more; that came to her which comes to every one—there was nothing new about it. Waldemar Daa stood grave and silent for a time; “The proudest tree may bend, but it does not break,” said something within him. The daughters wept, and every one else at the Castle was wiping their eyes; but Madam Daa had fared away, and I fared away too! Whew!—whew!’ said the wind.\\n‘The chopping and the sawing went on—the three-decker\\xa0was built. The master builder was a man of humble origin, but of noble loyalty; great power lay in his eyes and on his forehead, and Waldemar Daa liked to listen to him, and little Ida liked to listen too, the eldest fifteen-year-old daughter. But whilst he built the ship for her father, he built a castle in the air for himself, in which he and little Ida sat side by side as man and wife. This might also have happened if his castle had been built of solid stone, with moat and ramparts, wood and gardens. But with all his wisdom the shipbuilder was only a poor bird, and what business has a sparrow in a crane’s nest? Whew! whew! I rushed away, and he rushed away, for he dared not stay, and little Ida got over it, as get over it she must.‘I came back again; I often came back across the island of Funen and the waters of the Belt, and took up my place on Borreby shore close to the great forest of oaks. The ospreys and the wood pigeons used to build in it, the blue raven and even the black stork! It was early in the year; some of the nests were full of eggs, while in others the young ones were just hatched. What a flying and screaming was there! Then came the sound of the axe, blow upon blow; the forest was to be felled. Waldemar Daa was about to build a costly ship, a three-decked man-of-war, which it was expected the king would buy. So the wood fell, the ancient landmark of the seaman, the home of the birds. The shrike was frightened away; its nest was torn down; the osprey and all the other birds lost their nests too, and they flew about distractedly, shrieking in their terror and anger. The crows and the jackdaws screamed in mockery, Caw! caw! Waldemar Daa and his three daughters stood in the middle of the wood among the workmen. They all laughed at the wild cries of the birds, except Anna Dorothea, who was touched by their distress, and when they were about to fell a tree which was half-dead, and on whose naked branches a black stork had built its nest, out of which the young ones were sticking their heads, she begged them with tears in her eyes to spare it. So the tree with the black stork’s nest was allowed to stand. It was only a little thing.‘The fiery black horses stood neighing in the stables; they were worth looking at, and they were looked at to some purpose too. An admiral was sent from the King to look at the new man-of-war, with a view to purchasing it. The admiral was loud in his admiration of the horses. I heard all he said,’ added the wind. ‘I went through the open door with the gentlemen and scattered the straw like gold before their feet. Waldemar Daa wanted gold; the admiral wanted the black horses, and so he praised them as he did; but his hints were not taken, therefore the ship remained unsold. There it stood by the shore covered up with boards, like a Noah’s Ark which never reached the water. Whew! whew! get along! get along! It was a miserable business. In the winter, when the fields were covered with snow and the Belt was full of\\xa0ice-floes which I drove up on to the coast,’ said the wind, ‘the ravens and crows came in flocks, the one blacker than the other, and perched upon the desolate, dead ship by the shore. They screamed themselves hoarse about the forest which had disappeared, and the many precious birds’ nests which had been devastated, leaving old and young homeless; and all for the sake of this old piece of lumber, the proud ship which was never to touch the water! I whirled the snow about till it lay in great heaps round the ship. I let it hear my voice, and all that a storm has to say, I know that I did my best to give it an idea of the sea. Whew! whew!’‘The winter passed by; winter and summer passed away! They come and go just as I do. The snow-flakes, the apple blossom, and the leaves fall, each in their turn. Whew! whew! they pass away, as men pass too!‘The daughters were still young. Little Ida, the rose, as lovely to look at as when the shipbuilder turned his gaze upon her. I often took hold of her long brown hair when she stood lost in thought by the apple-tree in the garden. She never noticed that I showered apple-blossom over her loosened hair; she only gazed at the red sunset against the golden background of the sky, and the dark trees and bushes of the garden. Her sister Johanna was like a tall, stately lily; she held herself as stiffly erect as her mother, and seemed to have the same dread of bending her stem. She liked to walk in the long gallery where the family portraits hung. The\\xa0ladies were painted in velvet and silk, with tiny pearl embroidered caps on their braided tresses. Their husbands were all clad in steel, or in costly cloaks lined with squirrel skins and stiff blue ruffs; their swords hung loosely by their sides. Where would Johanna’s portrait one day hang on these walls? What would her noble husband look like? These were her thoughts, and she even spoke them aloud; I heard her as I swept through the long corridor into the gallery, where I veered round again.‘Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth, was only a child of fourteen, quiet and thoughtful. Her large blue eyes, as clear as water, were very solemn, but childhood’s smile still played upon her lips; I could not blow it away, nor did I wish to do so. I used to meet her in the garden, the ravine, and in the manor fields. She was always picking flowers and herbs, those she knew her father could use for healing drinks and potions. Waldemar Daa was proud and conceited, but he was also learned, and he knew a great deal about many things. One could see that, and many whispers went about as to his learning. The fire blazed in his stove even in summer, and his chamber door was locked. This went on for days and nights, but he did not talk much about it. One must deal silently with the forces of nature. He would soon discover the best of everything, the red, red gold!‘This was why his chimney flamed and smoked and sparkled. Yes, I was there, too,’ said the wind.‘The fiery steeds in the stable, where were they? The old gold and silver plate in cupboard and chest, where was that? The cattle, the land, the castle itself? Yes, they could all be melted down in the crucible, but yet no gold would come.‘Away with you, away! I sang in the back of the chimney. Smoke smoke, embers and ashes, that is all it will come to! You will burn yourself up in it. Whew! whew! away with it! But Waldemar Daa could not let it go.‘Barn and larder got emptier and emptier. Fewer servants; more mice. One pane of glass got broken and another followed it. There was no need for me to go in by the doors,’ said the wind. ‘A smoking chimney means a cooking meal, but the only chimney which smoked here swallowed up all the meals, all for the sake of the red gold.‘I blew through the castle gate like a watchman blowing his horn, but there was no watchman,’ said the wind. ‘I twisted round the weather-cock on the tower and it creaked as if the watchman up there was snoring, only there was no watchman. Rats and mice were the only inhabitants. Poverty laid the table; poverty lurked in wardrobe and larder. The doors fell off their hinges, cracks and crannies appeared everywhere; I went in and out,’ said the wind, ‘so I know all about it.‘The hair and the beard of Waldemar Daa grew grey, in the sorrow of his sleepless nights, amid smoke and ashes. His skin\\xa0grew grimy and yellow, and his eyes greedy for gold, the long expected gold.‘I whistled through the broken panes and fissures; I blew into the daughters’ chests where their clothes lay faded and threadbare; they had to last for ever. A song like this had never been sung over the cradles of these children. A lordly life became a woeful life! I was the only one to sing in the castle now,’ said the wind. ‘I snowed them up, for they said it gave warmth. They had no firewood, for the forest was cut down where they should have got it. There was a biting frost. Even I had to keep rushing through the crannies and passages to keep myself lively. They stayed in bed to keep themselves warm, those noble ladies. Their father crept about under a fur rug. Nothing to bite, and nothing to burn! a lordly life indeed! Whew! whew! let it go! But this was what Waldemar Daa could not do.‘”After winter comes the spring,” said he; “a good time will come after a time of need; but they make us wait their pleasure, wait! The castle is mortgaged, we are in extremities—and yet the gold will come—at Easter!”‘I heard him murmur to the spider’s web.—”You clever little weaver! You teach me to persevere! If your web is broken, you begin at the beginning again and complete it! Broken again—and cheerfully you begin it over again. That is what one must do, and one will be rewarded!”‘It was Easter morning, the bells were ringing, and the sun was at play in the heavens. Waldemar Daa had watched through the night with his blood at fever pitch; boiling and cooling, mixing and distilling. I heard him sigh like a despairing soul; I heard him pray, and I felt that he held his breath. The lamp had gone out, but he never noticed it; I blew up the embers and they shone upon his ashen face, which took a tinge of colour from their light; his eyes started in their sockets, they grew larger and larger, as if they would leap out.‘Look at the alchemist’s glass! something twinkles in it; it is glowing, pure and heavy. He lifted it with a trembling hand and shouted with a trembling voice: “Gold! gold!” He reeled, and I could easily have blown him over,’ said the wind, ‘but I only blew upon the embers, and followed him to the room where his daughters sat shivering. His coat was powdered with ash, as well as his beard and his matted hair. He drew himself up to his full height and held up his precious treasure, in the fragile glass: “Found! won! gold!” he cried, stretching up his hand with the glass which glittered in the sunbeams: his hand shook, and the alchemist’s glass fell to the ground shivered into a thousand atoms. The last bubble of his welfare was shattered too. Whew! whew! fare away! and away I rushed from the goldmaker’s home.\\n‘Ida and Ana Dorothea walked one on each side of him: Johanna turned round in the gateway, but what was the good of that? nothing could make their luck turn. She looked at the red stones of what had once been Marsk Stig’s Castle. Was she thinking of his daughters?’Late in the year, when the days were short and dark up here, and the fog envelops the red berries and bare branches with its\\xa0cold moisture, I came along in a lively mood clearing the sky and snapping off the dead boughs. This is no great labour, it is true, yet it has to be done. Borreby Hall, the home of Waldemar Daa, was having a clean sweep of a different sort. The family enemy, Ové Ramel from Basness, appeared, holding the mortgage of the Hall and all its contents. I drummed upon the cracked window panes, beat against the decaying doors, and whistled through all the cracks and crannies, whew! I did my best to prevent Herr Ové taking a fancy to stay there. Ida and Anna Dorothea faced it bravely, although they shed some tears; Johanna stood pale and erect and bit her finger till it bled! Much that would help her! Ové Ramel offered to let them stay on at the Castle for Waldemar Daa’s lifetime, but he got no thanks for his offer; I was listening. I saw the ruined gentleman stiffen his neck and hold his head higher than ever. I beat against the walls and the old linden trees with such force that the thickest branch broke, although it was not a bit rotten. It fell across the gate like a broom, as if some one was about to sweep; and a sweeping there was indeed to be. I quite expected it. It was a grievous day and a hard time for them, but their wills were as stubborn as their necks were stiff. They had not a possession in the world but the clothes on their backs; yes, one thing—an alchemist’s glass which had been bought and filled with the fragments scraped up from the floor. The treasure which promised much and fulfilled nothing.\\xa0Waldemar Daa hid it in his bosom, took his staff in his hand, and, with his three daughters, the once wealthy gentleman walked out of Borreby Hall for the last time. I blew a cold blast upon his burning cheeks, I fluttered his grey beard and his long white hair; I sang such a tune as only I could sing. Whew! whew! away with them! away with them! This was the end of all their grandeur.Was she thinking of that song? Here there were three and their father was with them. They walked along the road where once they used to ride in their chariot. They trod it now as vagrants, on their way to a plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, which was rented at ten marks yearly. This was their new country seat with its empty walls and its empty vessels. The crows and the magpies wheeled screaming over their heads with their mocking “Caw, caw! Out of the nest, Caw, caw!” just as they screamed in Borreby Forest when the trees were felled.‘Herr Daa and his daughters must have noticed it. I blew\\xa0into their ears to try and deaden the cries, which after all were not worth listening to.‘So they took up their abode in the plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, and I tore off over marshes and meadows, through naked hedges and bare woods, to the open seas and other lands. Whew! whew! away, away! and that for many years.’What happened to Waldemar Daa? What happened to his daughters? This is what the wind relates.‘The last of them I saw, yes, for the last time, was Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth. She was old and bent now; it was half a century later. She lived the longest, she had gone through everything.‘Across the heath, near the town of Viborg, stood the Dean’s new, handsome mansion, built of red stone with toothed gables. The smoke curled thickly out of the chimneys. The gentle lady and her fair daughters sat in the bay window looking into the garden at the drooping thorns and out to the brown heath beyond. What were they looking at there? They were looking at a stork’s nest on a tumble-down cottage; the roof was covered, as far as there was any roof to cover, with moss and house-leek; but the stork’s nest made the best covering. It was the only part to which anything was done, for the stork kept it in repair.‘Oh dear! oh dear! No bells rang over the grave of Waldemar Daa. No schoolboys sang when the former lord of Borreby Castle was laid in his grave. Well, everything must have an end, even misery! Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant, and this was her father’s sorest trial. His daughter’s husband a miserable serf, who might at any moment be ordered the punishment of the wooden horse by his lord. It is well that the sod covers him now, and you too, Ida! Ah yes! ah yes! Poor me! poor me! I still linger on. In Thy mercy release me, O Christ!”This house was only fit to be looked at, not to be touched. I had to mind what I was about,’ said the wind. ‘The cottage\\xa0was allowed to stand for the sake of the stork’s nest; in itself it was only a scarecrow on the heath, but the dean did not want to frighten away the stork, so the hovel was allowed to stand. The poor soul inside was allowed to live in it; she had the Egyptian bird to thank for that; or was it payment for once having pleaded for the nest of his wild black brother in the Borreby Forest? Then, poor thing, she was a child, a delicate, pale hyacinth in a noble flower-garden. Poor Anna Dorothea; she remembered it all! Ah, human beings can sigh as well as the wind when it soughs through the rushes and reeds.‘This was the prayer of Anna Dorothea, as she lay in the miserable hovel which was only left standing for the sake of the stork.‘I took charge of the boldest of the sisters,’ said the wind. ‘She had clothes made to suit her manly disposition, and took a\\xa0place as a lad with a skipper. Her words were few and looks stubborn, but she was willing enough at her work. But with all her will she could not climb the rigging; so I blew her overboard before any one discovered that she was a woman, and I fancy that was not a bad deed of mine!’ said the wind.‘On such an Easter morning as that on which Waldemar Daa thought he had found the red gold, I heard from beneath the stork’s nest a psalm echoing through the miserable walls. It was Anna Dorothea’s last song. There was no window; only a hole in the wall. The sun rose in splendour and poured in upon her; her eyes were glazed and her heart broken! This would have been so this morning whether the sun had shone upon her or not. The stork kept a roof over her head till her death! I sang at her grave,’ said the wind, ‘and I sang at her father’s grave. I know where it is, and hers too, which is more than any one else knows.‘The old order changeth, giving place to the new. The old high-road now only leads to cultivated fields, while peaceful graves are covered by busy traffic on the new road. Soon comes Steam with its row of waggons behind it, rushing over the graves, forgotten, like the names upon them. Whew! whew! Let us be gone! This is the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters. Tell it better yourselves, if you can,’ said the wind, as it veered round. Then it was gone.There\\xa0was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter of a mighty King. She was called Maid Maleen, and was very beautiful. As her father wished to give her to another, the Prince was rejected.But since they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would not give each other up, and Maid Maleen said to her father, “I can and will take no other for my husband.”Then the King flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter. When it was finished, he said, “Therein shall you be imprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if your perverse spirit is broken.”Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower; and then she and her waiting-woman were led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and from the earth. There they sat in the darkness, and knew not when day or night began. The King’s Son often went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound from without\\xa0pierced through the thick walls. What else could they do but lament and complain?Meanwhile, the time passed, and by the small amount of food and drink left they knew that the seven years were coming to an end. They thought the moment of their deliverance was come. But no stroke of the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to Maid Maleen that her father had forgotten her. As they had food for only a short time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, Maid Maleen said, “We must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall.”She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn. With great labor they succeeded in getting out one stone, then a second, and third. And when three days were over, the first ray of light fell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could look out.The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces; but how melancholy everything looked all around! Her father’s castle lay in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible.When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed. But where were they to go? The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven away the King, and slain all the inhabitants. They wandered forth to seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread. Their need was\\xa0so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with nettle-plants.When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried to get work everywhere. But wherever they knocked they were turned away, and no one would have pity on them.At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace. There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions.The King’s Son in whose kingdom they were, was, however, the very man who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen. His father had chosen another Bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked. The wedding was fixed, and the girl had already arrived. Because of her great ugliness, however, she shut herself in her room, and allowed no one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the kitchen.When the day came for the Bride and the Bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people. Then said she to Maid Maleen, “A great piece of luck has befallen you. I have sprained my foot, and cannot walk through the streets. You shall put on my wedding-clothes and take my place. A greater honor than that you cannot have!”Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, “I wish for no honor which is not suitable for me.”It was in vain, too, that the Bride offered her gold. At last\\xa0she said angrily, “If you do not obey me, it shall cost you your life. I have but to speak the word, and your head will lie at your feet.”Then she was forced to obey, and put on the Bride’s magnificent clothes and all her jewels. When she entered the royal hall, every one was amazed at her great beauty, and the King said to his son, “This is the Bride whom I have chosen for you, and whom you must lead to church.”The Bridegroom was astonished, and thought, “She is like my Maid Maleen, and I should believe that it was she herself, but she has long been shut up in the tower or dead.”He took her by the hand and led her to church. On the way was a nettle-plant, and she said:“What are you saying?” asked the King’s Son.“Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”He was surprised that she knew about her, but kept silence. When they came to the foot-plank into the churchyard, she said:“What are you saying there?” asked the King’s Son.“Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”When they came to the church-door, she said once more:“What are you saying there?” asked he.“Ah,” she answered, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”Then he took out a precious chain, put it round her neck, and fastened the clasp. Thereupon they entered the church, and the priest joined their hands together before the altar, and married them. He led her home but she did not speak a single word the whole way.When they got back to the royal palace, she hurried into the Bride’s chamber, put off the magnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed herself in her gray gown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck, which she had received from the Bridegroom.When the night came, and the Bride was to be led into the apartment of the King’s Son, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not observe the deception.As soon as every one had gone away, he said to her, “What did you say to the nettle-plant which was growing by the wayside?”“To which nettle-plant?” asked she; “I don’t talk to nettle-plants.”“If you did not do it, then you are not the true Bride,” said he.So she bethought herself, and said:She went out and sought Maid Maleen. “Girl, what have you been saying to the nettle?”“I said nothing but:The Bride ran back into the chamber, and said, “I know now what I said to the nettle,” and she repeated the words which she had just heard.“But what did you say to the foot-bridge when we went over it?” asked the King’s Son.“To the foot-bridge?” she answered. “I don’t talk to foot-bridges.”“Then you are not the true Bride.”She again said:and ran out and found Maid Maleen. “Girl, what did you say to the foot-bridge?”“I said nothing but:“That costs you your life!” cried the Bride, but she hurried into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,” and she repeated the words.“But what did you say to the church-door?”“To the church-door?” she replied; “I don’t talk to church-doors.”“Then you are not the true Bride.”She went out and found Maid Maleen, and said, “Girl, what did you say to the church-door?”“I said nothing but:“That will break your neck for you!” cried the Bride, and flew into a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the church-door,” and she repeated the words.“But where have you the jewel which I gave you at the church-door?”“What jewel?” she answered; “you did not give me any jewel.”“I myself put it round your neck, and I myself fastened it. If you do not know that, you are not the true Bride.”He drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her ugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, “How come you here? Who are you?”“I am your betrothed Bride, but because I feared lest the people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I commanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to go to church instead of me.”“Where is the girl?” said he; “I want to see her, go and bring her here.”She went out and told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and that they must take her out into the courtyard and strike off her head.The servants laid hold of Maid Maleen and wanted to drag\\xa0her out, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the King’s Son heard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden free.Lights were brought, and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the church-door.“You are the true Bride,” said he, “who went with me to church. Come with me now to my room.”When they were both alone, he said, “On the way to the church you did name Maid Maleen, who was my betrothed Bride. If I could believe it possible, I should think she was standing before me—you are like her in every respect.”She answered, “I am Maid Maleen, who for your sake was imprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and thirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty. To-day, however, the sun is shining on me once more. I was married to you in the church, and I am your lawful wife.”Then they kissed each other, and were happy all the days of their lives.The false Bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off.The tower in which Maid Maleen had been imprisoned remained standing for a long time, and when the children passed by it, they sang:'"

              "<p class=\"drop-cap\"><span class=\"smcap1\">There</span> was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter of a mighty King. She was called Maid Maleen, and was very beautiful. As her father wished to give her to another, the Prince was rejected.</p>\n",
              "<p>But since they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would not give each other up, and Maid Maleen said to her father, “I can and will take no other for my husband.”</p>\n",
              "<p>Then the King flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter. When it was finished, he said, “Therein shall you be imprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if your perverse spirit is broken.”</p>\n",
              "<p>Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower; and then she and her waiting-woman were led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and from the earth. There they sat in the darkness, and knew not when day or night began. The King’s Son often went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound from without pierced through the thick walls. What else could they do but lament and complain?</p>\n",
              "<p>Meanwhile, the time passed, and by the small amount of food and drink left they knew that the seven years were coming to an end. They thought the moment of their deliverance was come. But no stroke of the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to Maid Maleen that her father had forgotten her. As they had food for only a short time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, Maid Maleen said, “We must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall.”</p>\n",
              "<p>She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn. With great labor they succeeded in getting out one stone, then a second, and third. And when three days were over, the first ray of light fell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could look out.</p>\n",
              "<p>The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces; but how melancholy everything looked all around! Her father’s castle lay in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible.</p>\n",
              "<p>When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed. But where were they to go? The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven away the King, and slain all the inhabitants. They wandered forth to seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread. Their need was so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with nettle-plants.</p>\n",
              "<p>When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried to get work everywhere. But wherever they knocked they were turned away, and no one would have pity on them.</p>\n",
              "<p>At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace. There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions.</p>\n",
              "<p>The King’s Son in whose kingdom they were, was, however, the very man who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen. His father had chosen another Bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked. The wedding was fixed, and the girl had already arrived. Because of her great ugliness, however, she shut herself in her room, and allowed no one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the kitchen.</p>\n",
              "<p>When the day came for the Bride and the Bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people. Then said she to Maid Maleen, “A great piece of luck has befallen you. I have sprained my foot, and cannot walk through the streets. You shall put on my wedding-clothes and take my place. A greater honor than that you cannot have!”</p>\n",
              "<p>Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, “I wish for no honor which is not suitable for me.”</p>\n",

href=\"https://vanwinkles.com/bedtime-stories-have-existed-for-thousands-of-years\" class=\"accent\" target=\"_blank\">quite far</a>. This remarkable discovery speaks volumes as to the importance of telling bedtime stories to your child. Parents for literally thousands of years have told variations of the stories told today. It is an oral tradition of great importance and one that all parents should be doing. Not only is a bedtime story fun and relaxing, it is also an effective and important way to become closer with your child.</p>\\n<h5>What Is A Bedtime Story?</h5>\\n<hr class=\"margin50 left-align\">\\n<p>Bedtime stories are stories that are told after your child has gotten into bed for the evening. Many times they will ask for you to sit with them. This is an easy opportunity to offer to tell them a story. Young children especially love this because it is a treat for them and makes them feel truly important in that moment.</p>\\n<p class=\"margin100\">You can either read a classic story from a book, find a quick one online, or tell one from memory. Oftentimes a great bedtime story is improvised to suit the mood of your child in that particular moment. These stories are typically ones that have been told for many years in many different ways. Popular stories include ones about princesses and princes, great monsters and knights, children on adventures, and exciting tales with no particular ending to them. This latter type of story is interesting because it allows you to draw the same story out over many nights to keep your child interested and always wanting more.</p>\\n<h5>Develop Memories Together</h5>\\n<hr class=\"margin50 left-align\">\\n<p class=\"margin100\">Reading a bedtime story to your children is a great way to connect with them. It brings the family closer in an intimate setting that also makes the child feel special. Memories are made as stories are told. Your child will look forward to you sitting with them before they drift off to sleep. This time together is something that they will always cherish. These precious moments benefit everyone involved, and you will find that you look forward to the bedtime stories almost as much, or more, than your little one.</p>\\n<h5>Benefits Of Bedtime Stories</h5>\\n<hr class=\"margin50 left-align\">\\n<p>Telling bedtime stories is beneficial. Your child will find sleep coming in a peaceful way with a great story in their ears. It engages their imagination while giving them good dream material, and has been shown to calm down a busy child. Children do tend to be worked up at times, especially at night, and a nice story will put their fears to rest and allow them much-needed relaxation. You can make a story that shows them that the monster under their bed is not so bad, or that the shadows on their wall are their friends. The possibilities are endless with creative solutions to any nighttime issue.</p>\\n<p class=\"margin100\">Bedtime stories also teach your child in ways that are similar to fables, myths, and fairy tales. Reading bedtime stories is a compelling way of helping your child grow into a well-shaped individual. The fun part about bedtime stories is that you can make one up yourself and craft it into something unique and special. A special story goes a long way for a child with open ears, and you will become a source of great interest for your children.</p>\\n<h5>Resources</h5>\\n<hr class=\"margin50 left-align\">\\n<p

href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/category/bedtime-stories/\" title=\"Generations Of Tradition\\nThe art of telling a good bedtime story dates back quite far. This remarkable discovery speaks volumes as to the importance of telling bedtime stories to your child. Parents for literally thousands of years have told variations of the stories told today. It is an oral tradition of great importance and one that all parents should be doing. Not only is a bedtime story fun and relaxing, it is also an effective and important way to become closer with your child.\\nWhat Is A Bedtime Story?\\nBedtime stories are stories that are told after your child has gotten into bed for the evening. Many times they will ask for you to sit with them. This is an easy opportunity to offer to tell them a story. Young children especially love this because it is a treat for them and makes them feel truly important in that moment.\\nYou can either read a classic story from a book, find a quick one online, or tell one from memory. Oftentimes a great bedtime story is improvised to suit the mood of your child in that particular moment. These stories are typically ones that have been told for many years in many different ways. Popular stories include ones about princesses and princes, great monsters and knights, children on adventures, and exciting tales with no particular ending to them. This latter type of story is interesting because it allows you to draw the same story out over many nights to keep your child interested and always wanting more.\\nDevelop Memories Together\\nReading a bedtime story to your children is a great way to connect with them. It brings the family closer in an intimate setting that also makes the child feel special. Memories are made as stories are told. Your child will look forward to you sitting with them before they drift off to sleep. This time together is something that they will always cherish. These precious moments benefit everyone involved, and you will find that you look forward to the bedtime stories almost as much, or more, than your little one.\\nBenefits Of Bedtime Stories\\nTelling bedtime stories is beneficial. Your child will find sleep coming in a peaceful way with a great story in their ears. It engages their imagination while giving them good dream material, and has been shown to calm down a busy child. Children do tend to be worked up at times, especially at night, and a nice story will put their fears to rest and allow them much-needed relaxation. You can make a story that shows them that the monster under their bed is not so bad, or that the shadows on their wall are their friends. The possibilities are endless with creative solutions to any nighttime issue.\\nBedtime stories also teach your child in ways that are similar to fables, myths, and fairy tales. Reading bedtime stories is a compelling way of helping your child grow into a well-shaped individual. The fun part about bedtime stories is that you can make one up yourself and craft it into something unique and special. A special story goes a long way for a child with open ears, and you will become a source of great interest for your children.\\nResources\\nBe sure to check out the following classic stories to get some ideas for telling a great story.\">Bedtime Stories</a>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"cat-item cat-item-29\"><a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/category/christmas-stories/\" title=\"Christmas Stories\\nThere is no time of the year quite like Christmas. This holiday is a great time to read classic stories to your child. The amount of Christmas stories out there is immense. No matter your background, tradition, or culture you will find stories that can find an important home in your children&#039;s mind during the holiday season.\\nWell-known Christmas stories include:\\nA Christmas Carol\\nThe Snowman\\nRudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer\\n&#039;Twas the Night Before Christmas\\nIn different cultures, there are Christmas stories with different flavors, but similar messages of charity, family, love, and tradition. Some examples include:\\nThe Story of Babushka (Russia)\\nSanta Kullosu (South Korea)\\nBom Velhinho (Brazil)\\nWhy Tell Christmas Stories\\nThe importance of Christmas stories lies in the messages that they share.\\nRegardless of creed, culture, or country, there are universal messages to be taken from Christmas. This special holiday celebrates life, family, tradition, and community. Each of these elements wrap into a nice package that a child will enjoy.\\nChristmas stories teach children about the importance of giving to others. This shapes them for future interactions with other children, and as they grow, with other adults. They will also learn about why being close to family is something to cherish. This holiday period brings the family together, and children can benefit greatly from these stories.\\nBenefits Of Christmas Stories\\nBenefits of reading or telling Christmas stories are many.\\nYou will connect with your child with genuine quality time. Having a tight family unit has been shown to increase a child&#039;s self-esteem, self-value, and empathy for others. Research also says that bonding as a family helps a child&#039;s emotional and academic development.\\nYour child will associate this time of year with giving, love, sharing, and closeness. Having a strong tradition such as a Christmas story time will teach your child to associate the holidays with positive behavior rather than asking for more toys and such. Reading classic stories is a great way to shift the focus to more important values.\\nYour child will have his or her imagination excited in the best way possible. It almost goes without saying that stimulating a child&#039;s creativity, imagination, and mental faculties is of the utmost importance. Telling stories of magical reindeer, a jolly old man delivering gifts to all the children of the world, and of talking snowmen will bring joy to your young one.\\nBringing The Family Together\\nWhen the Christmas holidays do roll around, be sure to engage in activities that bring your family together. Out of the many things you can do as a family, such as baking, watching old films, wrapping gifts, and cooking, you can sit down and read stories to your child.\\nThis creates a tradition of family time that you can do each year. Your child will come to look forward to this, perhaps even more than the idea of gifts. Be sure to supplement the story telling and book reading with the watching of classic movies such as:\\nA Christmas Story\\nWhite Christmas\\nA Christmas Carol\\n\">Christmas Stories</a>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"cat-item cat-item-26\"><a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/category/fable/\" title=\"What are Fables?\\nFables are a beautiful way to teach your child about morals, life lessons, and impart the wisdom of the ages in an engaging manner. Fables are stories that have been told throughout past generations, trickling down to the present to deliver important lessons about life, nature, love, friendship, and being a good person. More often than not a fable involves one or more animals who can speak and relate to your child. These characters are usually involved in some sort of moral conundrum or faced with a unique challenge that activates a child&#039;s creativity. This excites their imaginations and brings them necessary knowledge in a comforting way. Fables are deeply philosophical but simple enough for even the younger ones to grasp.\\nPositive Impacts\\nThrough reading fables with your child you will be imparting truths to them that would otherwise be not so fun to teach. Each time you open up a book of fables your child will learn how to be brave in the face of adversity, how to cooperate with those close to them, how to accept everyone for who they are, and how to distinguish the wrong choice from the right one. These are effective tools that will stay with your child for their entire life because children are like little sponges. What you choose to read to them when they are still young can have an impact that is far reaching. Children have consistently loved reading fables, or having fables read to them, so do not be surprised when they ask for the fable book more than any others that they typically enjoy. Reading a fable is highly important in child development.\\nBenefits of Fables\\nThe benefits of reading fables to a child are exponential. Your child will:\\nbecome well-rounded morally\\nlearn important life lessons\\nhave a deeper connection with others\\nYour child will grow up having a more solid, rounded, and deeper moral foundation that will help shape his or her life choices as they grow up. The stories are memorable enough to where they will be able to recall at a moment&#039;s notice the imagery and situations presented in a classic fable. With this they will understand how to handle different situations in life that would otherwise be overwhelming or new. This will lead to better problem solving skills, especially when the problem involves their feelings and the feelings of others. Your child will have more empathy for those who are different than they are. This is something that is perhaps most important because all through life he or she will have to interact with unique individuals. Fables instill a kind of empathy that may be hard to pass on in other ways.\\nParents&#039; Guidance\\nAs a parent it is simple to get started with fables. Simply find a book of popular fables, such as Aesop&#039;s Fables, and make it a habit to read a story twice a week to your child. There also exist plenty of online collections if you want to get started right away. It takes almost no time. If you would like to do something new, special, and time-honored, try reading a fable to your child. The effort is small, but the benefits are endless.\">Fables</a>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"cat-item cat-item-14\"><a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/category/fairy-tales/\" title=\"Fairy Tales\\nMost of us have fond memories of fairy tales. Fairy tales include anything from certain timeless, magical animated films to classic books and stories. A fairy tale is a short story that tends to feature heavy connections to European folklore, magic, talking animals, and mystical creatures thrown together to make a fantastic story.\\nFamous examples of fairy tales include:\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\nCinderella\\nHansel and Gretel\\nLittle Red Riding Hood\\nMany fairy tales date back to the 1600s and earlier, and most of the famous ones today come from the Brothers Grimm and their collection of European folklore.\\nChildren love fairy tales because of the sense of wonder that comes from reading them. A fairy tale is a deep story, and many children connect to them because of the universal themes such as friendship, love, loss, growth, good, and evil.\\nThe Importance and Benefits of Fairy Tales\\nFairy tales benefit children in many ways. The first is that they are usually good stories. Fairy tales involve characters that the children can relate to or look up to. Typical protagonists in a fairy tale include knights, princes, princesses, elves, dwarfs, children, and other exciting types of characters. These characters find themselves in great peril and must use their wits, luck, and collected efforts to claim victory in the name of all that is good.\\nChildren also benefit from fairy tales because these types of stories come with various life lessons, morals, and deep wisdom. In Snow White the titular character finds herself in need of the seven mystical dwarfs in order to succeed in defeating the evil witch. Each dwarf has a different flaw – but also a different strength. Together they form a great party of adventurers and triumph over evil.\\nTo a child&#039;s mind a fairy tale hits all of the sweet spots, and this is important because it is key that your child exercises his or her imagination. A strong imagination helps a healthy brain to form.\\nSheila Kohler on Psychology Today said that &quot;it seems very important to me, perhaps even more important today, that these ancient stories should be repeated again and again. The violence within them is always contained within a satisfying structure with a reversal, and the requisite happy ending. Here good and evil are so conveniently and completely separate. There are no grey areas in the fairy tale.&quot;\\nThis distinction between good and evil helps the child to relate to the prince, princess, or other hero character and take from them important lessons on behavior and handling difficult situations.\\nGive Your Child Fairy Tales\\nAs a parent there is plenty that you can do, but most important is to give your child fairy tales to digest. Either read some to them, or if the child can read herself, offer them a collection of classic fairy tales.\\nFairy tales are great, fun teachers, and exciting tools to open up a child&#039;s mind. By exposing your young one to fairy tales you are including them in a timeless tradition.\">Fairy Tales</a>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"cat-item cat-item-28\"><a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/category/myth/\" title=\"What Are Myths?\\nA myth, in most cases, is a story that has been passed down for generations and is used to explain unkown natural forces. These old stories have been used for thousands of years to help man understand the world around him. Examples of myths are the names of constellations in the night sky, stories of great floods, and tales of mythical beings coming down to our world to pass on great knowledge.\\nA few popular myths include:\\nSanta Claus\\nEaster Bunny\\nGreek Titans\\nEgyptian Gods\\nVampires\\nAtlantis\\nMyths can be found in just about every culture that has existed on Earth. There are many similarities in stories, and not all of these stories are optimistic. It is important to understand what myths are best to be told to your child.\\nThe Importance of Myths\\nMyths are important for childhood development. This is because they can teach valuable lessons about how the world works while presenting these lessons in fun stories. Children already live with active imaginations. A myth engages that imagination and breeds creativity in the child.\\nMyths are also healthy for children. According to Dr. Matthew Lormper of Lenox Hill Hospital it is not &quot;bad for kids to believe in the myth...[i]magination is an integral part of growing up and helps the brain to be creative.&quot; The myth of Santa, for example, teaches children about giving to those in need in a positive way. Children who are taught this or similar myths pick up on that empathy and learn to carry that with them in life.\\nThe benefits of myths are twofold. One, the child will enjoy a great story. Sharing in this experience will connect them to generations that have shared the same story. Second, the child will take away valuable lessons from the myths.\\nEven as a child grows to understand that myths are more often than not untrue, it is good for them to have these stories as tools in developing. When a child is old enough to question the myth, simply ask the child what they think about the myth. If they doubt it you can explain to them that it is a story, but that the meaning behind the story is real, true, and ever-important.\\nTell Your Child A Myth\\nAs a parent you can choose to tell your child different myths. These not only teach lessons and excite the imagination of your child but they make excellent stories. Telling a good story to your child brings the two of you closer in a special way. These memories that you share together will last a lifetime while educating your child on the ways of the world as told by the ancients.\\nThere are a few ways that you can tell myths. You can:\\nRead from a book of ancient myths\\nGo online and print out famous myths\\nCreate a unique myth suited for your child\\nPass on the myths you were told as a child\\nSources:\\nhttp://www.livescience.com/42089-kid-s-belief-in-santa-is-healthy.html\\nhttp://www.learning-mind.com/let-children-believe-in-santa-claus-say-psychologists/\\nhttp://www.dl.ket.org/latin/mythology/whatisa.htm\\nhttp://www.pbs.org/mythsandheroes/myths_what.html\">Myth</a>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"cat-item cat-item-24\"><a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/category/poems-for-kids/\" title=\"Poems For Kids\\nPoetry is one of the most beautiful examples of the ingenuity of modern man. Poetry takes the written or spoken word and turns it into something magical. A poem is defined by dictionary.com as &quot;a composition in verse, especially one that is characterized by a highly developed artistic form and by the use of heightened language and rhythm to express an intensely imaginative interpretation of the subject.&quot;\\nIn other words, a poem takes words and paints wonderful pictures with them, using rhyme, repetition, and description to enhance the imagery.\\nOf course, a poem can really be anything, but when it comes to children&#039;s poems you will find that many of them:\\nPaint vivid pictures for the child and his or her mind&#039;s eye\\nTeach important lessons\\nEngage the imagination\\nDevelop the child&#039;s intellect\\nPoetry Is Vital\\nPoetry is important for children because it brings them only cognitive benefits. There are a few things in particular that you can expect from reading poetry to a child.\\nWhen children reads poetry, or have poetry read o them, their use of language is expanded upon. Poetry uses colorful descriptors, vivid details, and connections to nature. These aspects shape a young one&#039;s mind and helps them to learn new words, practice their speech, and learn to use context clues to understand a phrase.\\nRhyming is a fun tool to use to teach a child important lessons. Poems with strong rhymes can be fun for the kid to read and memorize. If these poems have morals or lessons to teach, the child will pick up on them much easier because of the interactive and fun nature of poetry.\\nYou can also expect to see emotional development happen. Some poems deal with the complex subjects of life, love, loss, and friendship. These poems act as teachers and reminders to the kids as they grow, absorb, and develop into little people.\\nRead, Read, Read\\nAs a parent there are a few ways to engage your child with poetry.\\nRead, read, read. By reading poetry often it will become a great habit and something that the child will look forward to. You can even let them choose their own books of poems the next time you are at the bookstore. Reading out loud is a key way to introduce the art of poetry.\\nWrite poetry. Writing poetry with your child is an awesome way to spend time. It is also a great way to get your child&#039;s mind working in a creative and artistic way, an important aspect to development. Help them write poetry. Teach them to rhyme. Make a little book of poems with them. This will not only teach them something new, but will allow you to spend time with them doing something fun and unforgettable together.\\nAs a parent, you are the main role model for your child. When you read poetry, your child will see it, hear it and subconsciously learn from you. Set a strong example. If your child sees you reaching for a book of poems often, they will take from this that poetry and reading are behavior to be mimicked. Reading is vital if you want your child to have a balanced, rounded, and intellectual upbringing. Help your child develop and engage in smart habits that will benefit them for life\">Poems for Kids</a>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"cat-item cat-item-4\"><a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/category/scary-stories/\" title=\"Spooky Tales\\nScary stories are one of the most timeless traditions among humans. If you think back to your own childhood you will more than likely remember being told scary stories. Perhaps you even told one yourself while sitting around a campfire, on your bed with friends, or in a dark room on a rainy night.\\nNot all scary stories need to be aimed at giving the utmost fright to a child as that can be detrimental to their mental and emotional well-being. These frightening tales of horror can be made suitable for children. The right way of telling it a scary story can be an exciting way to spend some time with your child.\\nBenefits Of Scary Stories\\nAs a parent you would not think that a scary story would be beneficial to a young child. However, depending on the age of the child a scary story can be fun, adventurous, and just frightening enough to send chills up their spine without causing too much excitement.\\nA well-told scary story will give your kid a new perspective on the unknown. Through the story the child will have to face some fear and be led to a resolution. It is key to have a positive ending where the main character, or the child, comes out not only alive but healthy, safe, and stronger than before. This sense of accomplishment will help your kid grow into a more confident person.\\nMacabre tales are effective stories that teach lessons of courage, adventure, and how to face one&#039;s fears. These are vital to a child. It is not important if your child is more afraid than others when it comes to things like darkness, being alone, or any other usual childhood concern. Most children will have something to gain from a great scary story.\\nAdvice For Scary Stories\\nAs a parent you are the one leading your child through the scary story. You need to be a strong figure for them in this moment so that the child does not regret having asked for this story in the first place. Your kid will be looking to you as an example. If the story is told in a menacing way it will only taint the child&#039;s perception and probably cause nightmares at some point.\\nShow confidence, courage, and respect as you weave tales of cosmic horror and wicked witches. Children have amazing imaginations. Activate them with a weird tale and they will love it; fail to control the amount of horror and they will be upset.\\nWhen telling a scary story remember to:\\nLead your child on a spooky journey\\nLet him or her be the hero\\nRefrain from using gory details\\nOffer a great and positive conclusion\\nAfter the scary story is told your child will probably have questions. If they appear to be too nervous perhaps it is not the best idea to tell more scary stories. However, scary stories are one of the most requested types of stories by children, especially around Halloween and other &quot;scary&quot; times so be sure to engage their curiousity if you feel that they are up for it. Only you know your child and their tendencies. Each kid is different, and you need to be smart about what stories you decide to tell!\">Scary Stories</a>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"cat-item cat-item-10\"><a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/category/scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark/\" title=\"Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark\\nNothing quite beats sitting in the dark and telling a good spooky tale of the macabre, of spiders and creepy crawlers, and of what lurks under the bed. For children of different ages, a scary story can be an exciting journey into the darker side of the imagination.\\nExamples\\nThere are many sources for great scary stories to tell kids in the dark. Whether you are around a campfire or simply sitting in bed, you need a starting point.\\nPopular scary stories come from folklore, fairy tales, myths, and local culture. Others are collected in books, websites, and other sources.\\nExamples of popular stories to tell in the dark include:\\nThe Hook Hand Killer\\nThe Vanishing Hitchhiker\\nHumans Can Lick, Too\\nDepending on the age of your child, you might want to tone some of the stories that you find down to a level of fright that is more appropriate for them. Younger children cannot handle stories that cause deep terror whereas a kid in their teens might be able to handle them. Always keep in mind your audience, especially if the child is young and still in important development phases.\\nWhy Tell Scary Stories In The Dark\\nTelling scary stories in the dark has many benefits.\\nThe first is that these situations teach a child how to overcome fear. A well-told story for youngsters might involve a strong ending where the person in peril finds success in overcoming the terror presented. Teaching a child that the dark may be overcome with strength, perseverance, and friendship is an important way to help them to develop confidence, inner strength, and relaxation in the face of fear.\\nSecond, a scary story told under the stars, in the dark, or on a rainy night bring together the family. A story told at any time can involve not only the younger children but the family as a whole unit. These precious moments are important to everyone involved, including the kids. Bring your family together and have each of you take turns telling a scary tale. See who can tell the spookiest story!\\nThese benefits have a wide reach and will impact your child&#039;s future in the best ways.\\nBe A Leader\\nWhen telling a scary story be sure to show bravery. Be a fine example of one who can overcome any bit of darkness that is thrown in your way.\\nIf you want your kids to become stronger in the face of adversity, be sure to show that you, the parent and leader of the family, are strong as well.\\nWhen telling a horror story be sure to:\\nAppear calm\\nUse your hands and facial expressions to set the mood\\nAlways have a strong conclusion where the good guys win\\nSmile after and comfort your child if they appear to be too frightened\\nBeing a leader also means showing your children that you care about spending time with them. Teach them by example to always have time to sit down as a family and share stories. This teaches a child about friendship, family, and community in a fun and exciting fashion.\">Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark</a>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"cat-item cat-item-2\"><a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/category/short-stories/\" title=\"What Is A Short Story?\\nA short story is a story that is not quite as long as a novel, or even a novella. The length is usually less than 20,000 words. On the low end of the spectrum a short story floats around 1,000 words. \\nShort stories typically include:\\nFleshed out characters\\nDeveloped stories with a solid beginning, middle, and conclusion\\nRealized themes despite the short length\\nFor children, a short story is an excellent way to get them excited about reading. Younger children who are new to the wonderful world of reading might not be ready to take on a full novel. Short stories can give children something to dive into without making them feel overwhelmed, especially if they do not finish it. Finishing a short story will give your kid a feeling of accomplishment that will only further his or her love for the written word. Consider a short story as a gateway into reading for your child.\\nWatch Their Minds Grow\\nWhen you hand your child a short story, whether as a standalone piece or one that is part of a larger collection, you are giving your kid the keys to creativity and imagination.\\nIf your child is old enough to read without your assistance you can expect to see them develop reading skills and comprehension, become fluent with your language, and further understand how sounds are put together to form words and sentences. The act of reading has been shown to stimulate a child&#039;s brain in ways that help them to grow into a smarter person.\\nA well-chosen short story will be rich in lessons, creativity, morals, and other important elements that all come together to give your child a well-rounded education. Watch as your child&#039;s mind grows into something beautiful, unique, and individual as they pick up a short story.\\nA child who reads tends to do better in school than one who does not. This is vital if you wish for your child to succeed in school. Reading and language comprehension make up the foundation of scholarly pursuits. Keep that in mind!\\nLead By Example\\nFor those children who cannot read yet, it is important for you as a parent to set a good example. There are various steps you can take to ensure that your child gets the most from short stories.\\nRead often, and make sure that you do so in front of your children. This places them in an intellectual environment and shows the importance of reading.\\nShare with your child a short story from your book. This makes them feel connected to you, especially if the short story is not strictly for an adult. Be sure that the story has no adult themes or any other elements that you might not wish for your little one to hear!\\nRead your child&#039;s short story books to them. Reading aloud to your child stimulates their mind, brings you together, and gets them involved in reading.\\nVisit the library as a family. Bringing your children to the library is an awesome way to explore the various short story collections. It will also get them more excited about reading.\\nNo matter your child&#039;s interests, there are plenty of ways you can get them into reading short stories. Use this as a way to jump start your child&#039;s journey into becoming a rounded, formed, and intellectual little person.\">Short Stories</a>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\"cat-item cat-item-8\"><a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/category/stories-for-kids-with-pictures/\" title=\"Stories For Kids With Pictures\\nNo matter the type of children&#039;s story, one that has pictures for the child to see can be much more exciting. Children&#039;s imaginations thrive when more than just their sense of sound is engaged. Sight plays a large role in shaping and activating a child&#039;s imagination. Look for stories that include pictures, photographs, drawings, and other sorts of visual stimuli.\\nThe Importance of Pictured Stories\\nChildren are fascinated by colorful or interesting pictures. Nothing quite gets their brains going like a picture book or similar.\\nA story with pictures is vastly important because it acts as an easy way to get your child into reading. A page of text might not seem exciting, but a page with words and fun images makes a kid want to know more.\\nParents more often than not want their child to develop a love for reading, and introducing stories along with pictures is one of the best and most beneficial ways of doing so. This is especially true for the younger children, namely those aged 7 and below.\\nStories with pictures:\\nGet kids excited about books\\nMake the story less boring\\nPaint a clear image for the child to associate with the words\\nBuild reading comprehension and imagination\\nPicture books have been shown to increase the listening, visual, and mental capacities of children. According to author Emma Walton Hamilton, picture books “also educate the ear and the eye... Nuances and subtleties, new vocabulary and meaningful ideas, all become available in the read aloud experience – for which picture books are inherently designed – and prepare children to become better listeners in later life. And because they’re picture books, the words tell only half the story. The rest is revealed by the art, which helps kids notice details in the world around them, plants the seeds for art appreciation, and teaches them to look beyond words for emotional clues with respect to communication.”\\nWhat You Can Do\\nThe simplest answer as to what you, as a parent, can do is to just start. Simply start reading a picture book or any kind of story with pictures to your child.\\nThis interaction is important for developing a deeper connection to your child, showing them something new, and introducing a fun way to learn. It takes only a little bit of time, but do not be surprised if your child begins to ask for more picture books rather than chapter books.\\nYou can try:\\nSetting aside 30 minutes a night for picture book reading\\nVisiting the bookstore together and letting your child pick out a new book based on the pictures\\nLetting your child try to tell a story using just the pictures from a children&#039;s story\\nStories with pictures for kids are effective tools for learning, as well as effective devices for more quality family time. Any sort of reading has been shown time and time again to help develop a child&#039;s mind, creativity and sense of self. Reading is a skill that grants one the keys to a rich life. Instill in your child a love for knowledge and watch as they blossom into a person of wonder and intellect, with a thirst for more knowledge. Give picture books a shot and see what happens!\">Stories for Kids with Pictures</a>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n</section><section id=\"tag_cloud-3\" class=\"widget widget_tag_cloud margin100 small-margin50\"><h6 class=\"widget-title margin20\">TAGS</h6><hr class=\"left-align margin30\"><div class=\"tagcloud\"><a href=\\'https://www.studentuk.com/tag/3-to-6-years-old/\\' class=\\'tag-link-22 tag-link-position-1\\' title=\\'184 topics\\' style=\\'font-size: 14.125pt;\\'>3 to 6 years old</a>\\n<a href=\\'https://www.studentuk.com/tag/7-to-10-years-old/\\' class=\\'tag-link-23 tag-link-position-2\\' title=\\'283 topics\\' style=\\'font-size: 22pt;\\'>7 to 10 years old</a>\\n<a href=\\'https://www.studentuk.com/tag/11-to-13-years-old/\\' class=\\'tag-link-25 tag-link-position-3\\' title=\\'191 topics\\' style=\\'font-size: 14.5625pt;\\'>11 to 13 years old</a>\\n<a href=\\'https://www.studentuk.com/tag/14-to-18-years-old/\\' class=\\'tag-link-27 tag-link-position-4\\' title=\\'135 topics\\' style=\\'font-size: 8pt;\\'>14 to 18 years old</a></div>\\n</section></aside><!-- #secondary -->\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</section>\\n</main><!-- #main -->\\n</div><!-- #primary -->\\n\\n</div><!-- #content -->\\n<section id=\"subscribe\" class=\"small-wrap dark-background cover-background\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/themes/studentuk/imgs/subscribe-to-kids-stories.png)\">\\n<img src=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/themes/studentuk/imgs/dragon.png\" class=\"dragon\" alt=\"Scary Stories Subscribe\">\\n<div class=\"row subscribe-content\">\\n<div class=\"column center\">\\n<h2 class=\"accent-color inline-block\">SUBSCRIBE NOW</h2> <h5 class=\"inline-block font-weight300 margin70 small-margin50\"><em>FOR FREE STORY DOWNLOADS AND UPDATES</em></h5>\\n<form id=\"newsletter\" action=\"https://www.studentuk.com/?na=s\" method=\"post\">\\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"subscription_name\" name=\"subscription_name\" class=\"extra\">\\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"_wpnonce\" name=\"_wpnonce\" value=\"fdb91bee2e\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wp_http_referer\" value=\"/category/bedtime-stories/\" />                                \\t<input id=\"nl\" type=\"hidden\" name=\"nl[]\" value=\"2\">\\n<input id=\"newsletter_action\" type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"studentuk_newsletter\">\\n<div class=\"input-container\"><input type=\"email\" id=\"subscription_email\" name=\"ne\" required autocomplete=\"off\"><span class=\"relative newsletter-submit inline-block\"><button>SUBSCRIBE</button><span class=\"spinner\"></span></span></div>\\n</form>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</section>\\n<footer>\\n<div class=\"small-wrap dark-background\">\\n<div class=\"row small-up-1 medium-up-5 center margin50\">\\n<div class=\"footer-links\">\\n<a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/about/\"><h6 class=\"inline-block\">ABOUT</h6></a>\\n<a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/contact/\"><h6 class=\"inline-block\">CONTACT</h6></a>\\n<a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/license/\"><h6 class=\"inline-block\">LICENSE</h6></a>\\n<a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/terms/\"><h6 class=\"inline-block\">TERMS</h6></a>\\n<a href=\"https://www.studentuk.com/privacy/\"><h6 class=\"inline-block\">PRIVACY</h6></a>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"row margin50\">\\n<div class=\"columns small-12 center\">\\n<div><small class=\"black-color alt-font\">THANKS TO</small></div>\\n<ul id=\"credit\" class=\"inline-block\">\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/themes/studentuk/imgs/project-gutenberg-logo.png\" alt=\"Project Gutenberg\"></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://www.freepik.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/themes/studentuk/imgs/freepik-logo.png\" alt=\"Freepik\"></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pexels.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/themes/studentuk/imgs/pexels-logo.png\" alt=\"Pexels\"></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/themes/studentuk/imgs/wikimedia-commons-logo.png\" alt=\"Wikimedia Commons\"></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://subtlepatterns.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.studentuk.com/wp-content/themes/studentuk/imgs/subtlepatterns-logo.png\" alt=\"Subtlepatterns\"></a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"row margin40\">\\n<div class=\"columns center\">\\n<small class=\"black-color alt-font\"><em>Copyright notice:</em> These stories are published on sites other than studentuk.com and NONE of them are excerpted or quoted in MWE-created materials.
